Title: Welcome to ApeCoin DAO
Category: General
Author: River

The DAO
ApeCoin DAO exists because decentralized governance is critical to building and managing
a globally dispersed community—and therefore critical to the success of the APE
ecosystem. ApeCoin is governed by and for the community. If you hold ApeCoin, you’re
automatically a part of the DAO and able to participate in governance by putting forward
and voting on APE Improvement Proposals (AIPs).

The Foundation
The APE Foundation serves the ApeCoin DAO to steward the growth and development of the
APE ecosystem in a fair and inclusive way. It utilizes the Ecosystem Fund, which is
controlled by a multisig wallet, to pay its expenses as directed by the ApeCoin DAO and
provides an infrastructure for ApeCoin holders to collaborate through open and
permissionless processes 54.

Discourse
Discourse is an open source discussion platform and the first stop for all AIPs. Here,
members of the community can discuss matters of relevance to the ecosystem and provide
feedback on AIPs. This informal dialectic helps AIP authors to strengthen their proposals
and promotes AIPs that are informed by values and goals of the community.

Proposal Process
Discourse is used for idea generation, community discussion, and the preparation of the
AIP Draft. A brief description of the process is below. See the Proposal Process 66 on
the ApeCoin website for further details.

All Topics submitted in Discourse must be approved by a moderator. If it is rejected,
you will be contacted by a moderator directly. If approved, it is open for 7 days.
When the Topic is closed, a moderator will message the author of the Topic directly in
Discourse to put together the AIP Draft.
The AIP Draft will go through the moderation, analysis, and review process.
Moderators will update the community on the status of the Topics in the comments after
the Topic is closed.
Approved AIPs will be put on Snapshot for vote.

Voting Process
All Live AIPs will be posted for vote at the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot 30. A brief summary of
the process is below. See the Voting section 19 on the ApeCoin website for further details.

New AIPs are posted every week on Thursday at 9PM ET and close the following Wednesday at
9PM ET.
ApeCoin DAO members may delegate their votes to another ApeCoin DAO member. Delegation
must occur prior to the posting of the AIP on Snapshot.

Guidelines for Engagement on Discourse

This is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion
Please treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park. We,
too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests
through ongoing conversation. These are not hard and fast rules. They are guidelines to
aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a kind, friendly place for
civilized public discourse.

Improve the Discussion
Help us make this a great place for discussion by always adding something positive to the
discussion, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think
over what you want to say and try again later.
One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening.
Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have
a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.
The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you,
too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree
with some of what is being said.

Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree
You may wish to respond by disagreeing. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas,
not people. Please avoid:
Name-calling
Ad hominem attacks
Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content
Knee-jerk contradiction
Instead, provide thoughtful insights that improve the conversation.
Your Participation Counts

The conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the
future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an
interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.
Discourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best
(and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, watching, muting and
so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.
Let’s leave our community better than we found it.

If You See a Problem, Flag It
Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you.
With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.
When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. Replying encourages bad behavior by acknowledging
it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it. If enough flags
accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.
In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content
and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts;
the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the
community.

Always Be Civil
Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:
Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive,
or hate speech.
Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their
private information.
Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.
These are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any
of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was
featured on the front page of a major news site.
This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language,
links, and images safe for family and friends.

Keep It Tidy
Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time
discussing and less cleaning up. So:
Don’t start a topic in the wrong category; please read the category definitions.
Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.
Don’t post no-content replies.
Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.
Don’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.
Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an
existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.

Post Only Your Own Stuff
You may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission.
You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s
intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.
Powered by You

This site is operated by your friendly local staff and you, the community. If you have
any further questions about how things should work here, open a new topic in the site
feedback category and let’s discuss! If there’s a critical or urgent issue that can’t
be handled by a meta topic or flag, contact us via the staff page.

The APE Foundation website is the DAO hub, providing an interface to educate DAO members
on the governance process and provide easy access to the channels below in order to
streamline the DAO’s operation and enhance its utility.

Discourse is the first stop for all proposals. An AIP (Ape Improvement Proposal) Idea is
submitted as a post in Discourse and must receive confirmation from a moderator that it
complies with DAO-approved guidelines before it appears to the community. ApeCoin holders
must go through a wallet authentication process to post ideas or give feedback to ideas
via comments. Snapshot is used for voting. Proposal drafts that have passed their
respective approval processes become available for voting on Snapshot. ApeCoin holders
must go through a wallet authentication process to vote.

APECOIN IS FOR THE WEB3 ECONOMY.
Culture has found new expression in web3 through art, gaming, entertainment, and events.
The possibilities for blockchain’s impact on culture are so endless that they can’t
possibly all be predicted yet. APE is a token made to support what’s next, controlled and
built on by the community. It will serve as a decentralized protocol layer for
community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse.

THE APE FOUNDATION
The APE Foundation is the steward of ApeCoin. It is not an overseer, but the base layer
on which ApeCoin holders in the ApeCoin DAO can build.

The Foundation facilitates decentralized and community-led governance and is designed to
become more decentralized over time. It is tasked with administering the decisions of the
ApeCoin DAO, and is responsible for day-to-day administration, bookkeeping, project
management, and other tasks that ensure the DAO community’s ideas have the support they
need to become a reality.

The goal of the APE Foundation is to steward the growth and development of the APE
ecosystem in a fair and inclusive way. It utilizes the Ecosystem Fund, which is
controlled by a multisig wallet, to pay its expenses as directed by the ApeCoin DAO and
provides an infrastructure for ApeCoin holders to collaborate through open and
permissionless governance processes.

THE DAO
ApeCoin DAO exists because decentralized governance is critical to building and managing
a globally dispersed community—and therefore critical to the success of the APE ecosystem.

The APE Improvement Proposal Process (see Governance) will allow ApeCoin DAO members to
make decisions regarding Ecosystem Fund allocations, governance rules, projects,
partnerships, and beyond. ApeCoin DAO membership is open to all ApeCoin holders.

THE BOARD
The Special Council of the APE Foundation provides, at the behest of the ApeCoin DAO
members, stewardship and oversight of the APE Foundation. The Special Council members
exist to serve the vision of ApeCoin DAO.

It does this by the following, though they are not limited to the items listed below:

Conducting detailed administrative reviews of AIPs according to the process outlined in
AIP-1
Ensuring the implementation of the ApeCoin DAO’s intentions and wishes as manifested
through approved AIPs

Safeguarding and stewarding the ApeCoin DAO treasury
Serving as primary community liaisons with the APE Foundation and its service providers
in Cayman Islands, facilitating open and effective communication channels

Overseeing the Ape Foundation administrators and other foundation service providers,
ensuring they execute their duties with efficiency and timeliness, aligned with the
ApeCoin DAO's objectives and values.


AIP-1: Proposing the DAO
Category: Process
Submitted by: Cartan Group LLC

ABSTRACT
This document proposes the structure of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)
that would be governed by the holders of ApeCoin, a decentralized token that the
community hopes will serve as the primary token for art, gaming, entertainment, and
events in web3.

MOTIVATION
APE Foundation, which will serve the ApeCoin DAO community and be governed by it, aims
to be the heart of art, gaming, entertainment, and events on the blockchain.

The ApeCoin DAO community will have the power to submit proposals, vote on the most
exciting and promising ideas, and make them real.

The guiding values of APE Foundation are:

Boldness: We don’t shy away from the weird, the hard, or the new.
Equality: One APE equals one APE.
Transparency: Processes and decisions are shared openly with the community.
Collective Responsibility: We leave everything better than we found it.
Persistence: Success is an ouroboros, not a straight line.

RATIONALE
APE Foundation serves the ApeCoin DAO in fostering a community of creators and everyday
innovators with aligning motivation and values to shape the future of web3.

The short-term vision is to facilitate the launch of the best product feasible today in
a way that aligns with the DAO’s motivation and values by balancing productivity and
governance with bottom-up contribution, while minimizing politics.

To achieve this, it is imperative that participating in idea submission, commentary,
proposal submission, and voting is restricted to ApeCoin DAO members. Holding ApeCoin is
the only requirement for membership in the DAO.

In keeping with the core APE Foundation value of transparency, all ideas and commentary
in Discourse, proposals, votes cast, and voting outcomes will be publically available
to view.

GUIDELINES

Every year, there is a DAO-wide vote to determine which DAO members will serve on a
special council on the APE Foundation (the DAO’s “Board”). The purpose of the Board is
to administer DAO proposals and serve the vision of the community.

A Board member may be removed and replaced prior to the term pursuant to a majority vote
of token holders.
The total cost of implementation must be clear in order for a proposal to go to vote.

DAO members must search past proposals to ensure any idea they intend to write a proposal
for has not already been submitted.
If a suggested proposal directly conflicts with a proposal that is currently up for vote,
the second proposal should not go for a vote until a decision is made on the first proposal
to avoid approval of opposing requirements.
A suggested proposal that directly conflicts with another approved proposal cannot go to
vote for three months after the original proposal has been implemented to avoid wasting
community assets.

Proposals will not be considered/put up for a vote if they involve illegal activity, hate
speech, pornographic material, or are at odds with the mission or values of the APE Foundation.

KEY TERMS
AIP (APE Improvement Proposal) - a document proposing a new feature, project, activity, goal,
piece of information, or change to any proposal that has already been implemented.

AIP Idea - the first step in the process of creating an official AIP, which will be
presented to the community for gathering informal feedback for a period of seven days.

AIP Draft - the second step in the process of creating an official AIP, which can only be
submitted after the original AIP idea has gathered feedback from the community for seven
days in the proper channel. An AIP draft must be submitted directly to a moderator via
predetermined AIP templates.

AIP Template - the preset format for an AIP draft, which will vary slightly depending on
the nature of the intended AIP.

AIP Author - the DAO member responsible for beginning the APE Improvement Process,
starting with presenting the idea to the community via the proper AIP idea process.

The AIP author is responsible for incorporating relevant feedback, submitting the
subsequent AIP draft via the proper AIP template to the moderator, and responding to 
questions or requests for clarifications from DAO members and moderators. Any ApeCoin
holder can be an AIP author.

AIP Categories - the predetermined classification system for organizing AIPs by their
nature or intent. They are: Core Proposal, Ecosystem Fund Allocation Proposal
(a subcategory of Core Proposal), Brand Decision Proposal
(a subcategory of Core Proposal), Process Proposal, and Informational Proposal.

Core Proposal - a proposal that would be considered the main activities of the DAO, with
subcategories that can be expanded on over time via proposal submission.

Ecosystem Fund Allocation Proposal - a proposal about how the Ecosystem Fund should be
spent. A subcategory of Core Proposals.

Brand Decision Proposal - a proposal about to whom the community wants to attach its
name. This is different from an Ecosystem Fund Allocation Proposal in that it can have
associated costs to implement but is not at its core a proposal about Ecosystem Fund
Allocation. A subcategory of Core Proposals.

Process Proposal - a proposal about making a change to a process or proposing an
implementation. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making
process, and changes to the tools or environment of the DAO or Foundation.

Informational Proposal - a proposal that provides general guidelines or information to
the community but does not propose a new feature.

Resubmission Proposal - a proposal that was previously submitted but did not pass either
due to initial rejection by moderators or the Board, or by not passing a vote. All
proposal categories have a special template for resubmission that the author must link
to the original proposal, clearly state why it did not pass, and clearly explain how
the resubmission is different.

AIP Analysis Report - a report conducted by a project management team engaged by the
APE Foundation to ensure that all costs, steps to implement, legal considerations,
third-party review requirements, potential conflicts of interests, and any further
implications have been properly considered and identified. This is considered to be a
service for the community given that AIP authors will be submitting drafts with little
to no resources.

APE Improvement Proposal Draft & Analysis Report (AIP DAR Package) - both the AIP Draft
(submitted by the author) and the AIP Analysis Report (submitted by the project
management team engaged by the APE Foundation) should be defined as a package after the
analysis report is conducted, as they should only be considered together from that point on.

AIP Moderation - the act of reviewing an AIP DAR Package to determine whether or not the
AIP draft meets the predetermined and DAO-approved guidelines and therefore is eligible
to move to the next step in the process. If an AIP DAR Package passes AIP moderation,
it becomes a Pending AIP.

Pending AIP - the AIP status after AIP DAR, which is only reached if it passes AIP Moderation.
Post-Moderation Tagging - the process of tagging all Pending AIPs that have successfully
been through the AIP analysis report and AIP moderation phases. There are two tags given
at this stage: 1) “Straight to Vote,” which is for any pending AIP where costs, content,
and implications are considered to be straightforward and of no risk to the well-being
of the DAO. 2) “Needs Administrative Review,” which is for any pending AIP with costs,
content, or implications that are considered to be complicated or a potential risk to the
well-being of the DAO and therefore must be reviewed by the Board of the DAO.

Administrative Review - the process of evaluating pending AIPs that have been tagged as
“Needs Administrative Review” to determine whether they should be halted or sent to vote
by the community.

Return for Clarification - a type of administrative classification that requires the AIP
author to clarify certain information regarding the Pending AIP. This classification would
be given in cases such as cost to implement being unclear, proposing to utilize a larger
percentage of the Ecosystem Fund than is justified based on the value it would provide to
the community, or being in direct conflict with an active AIP.

Return for Reconstruction - a type of administrative classification that requires the
proposer to restart the proposal submission process because the Pending AIP violates
DAO-approved requirements, or in cases of violation of the law, reasonable suspicion
of fraud or other misleading information, or the pending AIP being at odds with the
mission, values, or well-being of the Foundation or DAO.

Weekly AIP Release - every Thursday at 9PM ET, when all AIPs that are ready to go live
are released together in a batch.

Weekly Voting Close - when all AIPs in a Weekly AIP Release batch close for voting,
which happens the following Wednesday at 9PM ET.

Live AIP - an AIP that has passed all required approval stages and is launched for the
community to vote on it. The voting options for a Live AIP are “In favor” and “Against.”
Voting “In favor” means the voter is in favor of implementing the AIP exactly as-is.

Voting “Against” means the vote is against implementing the AIP exactly as-is — you may
vote “Against” to encourage the author to resubmit the AIP after making changes.

Final AIP - an AIP that has completed the voting process. There are two subcategories here: Accepted and Rejected.

Implementation of Accepted AIP - the process of implementing an AIP that has been
accepted by the community via a vote, based on the predetermined steps laid out in the
Draft/Template and Analysis Report phases.

THE PROCESS
Phase 1: AIP Idea

An AIP Idea is submitted as a post in Discourse and must receive confirmation from a
moderator that it complies with DAO-approved guidelines before it appears to the community.
The person or people submitting the AIP Idea will be referred to as the author or authors.

Multiple members can work together on an AIP idea, but it should be submitted only once.
The AIP idea informally gathers comments via Discourse.
Seven days after being posted in the Discourse, the community feedback process for the AIP Idea will close.

Phase 2: AIP Draft

Once the seven-day feedback window has passed and a moderator has closed the Discourse topic, a
moderator will provide the AIP author with the appropriate template.
A proposal typically includes:
Abstract - Two or three sentences that summarize the proposal.

Motivation - A statement on why the APE Community should implement the proposal.

Rationale - An explanation of how the proposal aligns with the APE Community’s
mission and guiding values.

Key Terms (optional) - Definitions of any terms within the proposal that are unique to
the proposal, new to the APE Community, and/or industry-specific.

Specifications - A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.

Steps to Implement - The steps to implement the proposal, including associated costs,
manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable.

Timeline - Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones,
and completion dates.

Overall Cost - The total cost to implement the proposal.
The author will fill out the template based on the original AIP Idea, incorporating any
feedback provided by the community that helps the idea better serve the DAO.

The author can add additional fields to the template if necessary to fully communicate
the intentions, specifics, and implications of the AIP Draft.
Proposals that did not make it through the respective approval process and are being
resubmitted should also include:

Link to original proposal
Reason it was not approved
Changes that have been made and why it should now be approved
Category options:
Core: Ecosystem Fund Allocation
Core: Ecosystem Fund Allocation (Resubmission)
Core: Brand Decision
Core: Brand Decision (Resubmission)

Process
Process (Resubmission)
Informational
Informational (Resubmission)
The moderator may then continue communication with the author to inform them of any
incorrect or missing information that needs to be changed—or clarifications that need to
be made—in order for the AIP Draft to comply with the DAO-approved guidelines and move
to the next step.
If the author does not respond to a moderator’s request to change, update, or make
clarifications on the AIP Draft within 30 days, the AIP Draft will be automatically
rejected as having failed to comply with the DAO-approved guidelines.
When the moderator confirms that an AIP Draft complies with the DAO-approved guidelines,
they assign a number to the AIP for identification purposes throughout the rest of the
process. From this point on, the AIP is referred to as “AIP-#: (Name) - (Category)”.
For example, this AIP is “AIP-1: Proposing the DAO - Process”.

Phase 3: AIP Analysis Report

The AIP Draft is then reviewed by a project management team engaged by APE Foundation,
who will provide an in-depth AIP Analysis Report.
The purpose of the AIP Analysis Report is to ensure that all costs, steps to implement,

legal considerations, third-party review requirements, potential conflicts of interests,
and any further implications have been properly considered and identified in order to
ensure the DAO members have enough information to make an informed decision.

This is considered to be a service for the DAO community given that AIP authors may be
submitting drafts with little to no resources.

Phase 4: AIP Moderation

The AIP DAR Package is reviewed by a team of moderators.
The AIP DAR Package will either be approved or not approved based on whether it adheres
to the DAO-approved guidelines.
If an AIP DAR Package is approved as complying with DAO-approved guidelines, it becomes
a Pending AIP and moves to Phase 5.
If an AIP DAR Package fails to comply with DAO-approved guidelines, it is eligible for
resubmission unless in cases of violation of the law or reasonable suspicion of fraud or
other misleading information.

Phase 5: Post-Moderation Tagging

Pending AIPs that have passed AIP Moderation will then either be tagged as “Straight to
Vote” or “Needs Administrative Review”’ as each term is defined and described in this Proposal.
The “Straight to Vote” tag is given for any pending AIP whose costs, content, and implications
are considered to be straightforward and of no risk to the well-being of the DAO. Any
Pending AIP that is tagged as “Straight to Vote” will skip to Phase 7.
The “Needs Administrative Review” tag is given for any pending AIP whose costs, content,
or implications are considered to be complicated or a potential risk to the well-being
of the DAO. Any Pending AIP that is tagged as “Needs Administrative Review” must go
through Phase 6.

Phase 6: Administrative Review

This phase is only for Pending AIPs that have been tagged with “Needs Administrative Review.”
When this happens, the Board, serving in an administrative capacity, will determine
whether further action is required prior to a Pending AIP proceeding to Phase 7.

Pending AIPs that the Board determines do not require additional action will be tagged
as “Approved for Voting” and proceed to Phase 7.
If the Board decides to return a Pending AIP for further clarification or action, they
must provide a clear explanation of why and tag it as either “Return for Reconstruction”
or “Return for Clarification.”
Reasons to tag as “Return for Reconstruction” or “Return for Clarification” may include
but are not limited to:

Cost to implement unclear/not able to be calculated (tagged as “Return for Clarification”)
Proposes to use more than 5% of the Ecosystem Fund (tagged as “Return for Clarification”)
Conflicts with another proposal (tagged as “Return for Clarification”)

Proposal is at odds with the mission/values of the DAO (tagged as “Return for Reconstruction”)
Proposal is at odds with the well-being of the DAO (tagged as “Return for Reconstruction”)
Violations of law, or against advice of counsel for APE Foundation (tagged as “Return for Reconstruction”)

Reasonable suspicion of fraud or other misleading information (tagged as “Return for Reconstruction”)

Phase 7: Live AIP

Drafts that have passed their respective approval processes will become a Live AIP on
Snapshot during the next Weekly AIP Release, which is when new AIPs are released in
batches every Thursday at 9PM ET.

Moderators are the only ones that can post AIPs to Snapshot because they must ensure
that each one has gone through the correct approvals process.
Once live on Snapshot, Live AIPs are open to voting until Weekly Voting Close, which
is when all Live AIPs from a given batch close for voting at 9PM ET on the Wednesday
following their release.
The voting options are “In favor” and “Against.” Voting “In favor” means the voter
is in favor of implementing the AIP exactly as-is. Voting “Against” means the vote is
against implementing the AIP exactly as-is — voters may vote “Against” to encourage
the author to resubmit the AIP after making changes.

Phase 8: Final AIP

If by the Vote Close Time the Live AIP has not gotten any votes or is tied, it will
be tagged as “Stalled” and be eligible for Resubmission.
In all other cases, after the Vote Close Time, Live AIPs are moved to Final AIPs.

There are two subcategories for the Final AIP status: accepted and rejected.
Rejected Final AIPs will have the chance to be resubmitted via the appropriate
Resubmission Template if the author contacts a moderator to initiate this process.

Accepted Final AIPs will move into implementation.

Phase 9: Implementation

For Accepted Final AIPs, implementation will begin based on the steps outlined in the AIP
template.
The project management team engaged by the APE Foundation is responsible for making sure
this happens but not responsible for doing it themselves.

The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be
immaterially or materially altered to optimize for security, usability, to protect APE
holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an
AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.

SPECIFICATIONS
DAO Hub: APE Foundation website, which will provide an interface to educate DAO members
on the governance process and provide easy access to the channels described below in
order to streamline the DAO’s operation and enhance its utility.

Communication Channel: Discourse (Phase 1)
ApeCoin holders must go through a wallet authentication process to post ideas or give
feedback to ideas via comments.
AIP Idea posts must be approved by a moderator to ensure it meets all predetermined
guidelines and template requirements.

All posts and comments will be regularly monitored by both a team of community managers
engaged by the APE Foundation and by the DAO community members themselves. There will be
zero tolerance for hate speech anywhere on this platform.

The author of an idea via a post in Discourse cannot edit the original post. If the
author wants to propose changes to the original idea, the author must do this via the
comments.

Seven (7) days after it has been posted, ideas become closed to community feedback
and will be locked by a moderator or community manager.
Process for Draft Submission via Template: (Phase 2)

Once an idea is locked in Discourse after the seven-day community feedback period,
a moderator will contact the author to provide the appropriate template.
The author should then submit an official AIP draft to the moderator using the
template.

The moderator may then continue communication with the author to inform them of any
incorrect or missing information that needs to be changed—or clarifications that
need to be made— for the AIP Draft to move to the next step.

If the author does not respond to a moderator’s request to change, update, or make
clarifications on the AIP Draft within 30 days, the AIP Draft will be automatically rejected.
Platform where Live AIPs are Hosted: Snapshot (Phase 7)

ApeCoin holders must go through a wallet authentication process to vote on Snapshot.
Moderators are the only ones allowed to launch AIPs on Snapshot as they must ensure each
AIP has gone through the correct approval process.

See AIP-2 for further details.

AIP-2: Voting Process
Category: Process
Author: Cartan Group LLC

ABSTRACT
This document proposes the voting protocol for the DAO outlined in AIP-1.

MOTIVATION
The main motivation behind this proposal is to create the voting infrastructure for
ApeCoin holders to participate in the decision-making of the DAO, the governing body of
the Foundation. The core criteria for the proposed voting system are:

not requiring gas payment
ensuring transparency
expanding governance participation to all holders of ApeCoin
One of the goals of launching a token was to facilitate decentralized community
governance in the form of the ApeCoin DAO. Without a voting system in place, arriving at
consensus on proposals would be centralized, with only a few people holding
decision-making abilities. This proposal aims to avoid this result.

RATIONALE
As the ecosystem evolves and expands, a well-defined system is required to gather new
community ideas and provide a clear path for these ideas to be approved for
implementation. A proposal process is foundational to this system becoming a reality.

A proposal process, however, needs an accompanying consensus mechanism. It must be fair,
transparent, and low-cost to place votes. Balancing each of these requirements is
challenging. On-chain solutions make it costly to vote. Off-chain solutions, like the one
proposed, are less expensive, but require actions to take place off chain.

This proposal outlines a voting protocol that seeks to balance the pros and cons of 
voting approaches, and to hold up the core APE Foundation guiding values of equality and
transparency. This voting protocol can be found below in the following SPECIFICATIONS
section.

SPECIFICATIONS
Assuming the approval of AIP-1, implement Snapshot as the voting mechanism / protocol
where:

Only ApeCoin token holders may vote
Token holders will have the ability to delegate votes
New proposals that meet the required guidelines will be launched in batches every
Thursday at 9PM ET
The voting opens immediately upon launch
The voting options for a Live AIP are “In favor” and “Against.” Voting “In favor” means
the voter is in favor of implementing the AIP exactly as-is. Voting “Against” means th
 vote is against implementing the AIP exactly as-is — one may vote “Against” to encourage
 the author to resubmit the AIP after making changes.
The voting for each proposal in each weekly batch will be open for voting for six days,
closing at 9PM ET on the following Wednesday
Proposals that are approved by the holders of the requisite number of ApeCoin are moved
to the APE Foundation for implementation
Only moderators can post AIPs to Snapshot because they must ensure that each one has
gone through the correct approvals process

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT
Purchased ENS domain
Created specific space on Snapshot
Implemented ecosystem-specific voting strategy
Set administrator addresses
Set voting rules
Set restrictions in Snapshot so that only moderators can launch proposals

AIP-9: Boring Security - Ecosystem Fund Allocation
Category: Ecosystem Fund Allocation
Author: Feld

ABSTRACT
This document outlines the Boring Security Mission statement and alignment with the
greater BAYC and NFT community. In order to grow the pie, we must first secure the
crust, and protect the gooey insides from malicious actors.

MOTIVATION
The Boring Security DAO has tracked over $50mm worth of hacked/scammed NFTs in the
space and has attributed it largely to lack of awareness and education on the NFT
communities’ part. There have been no large-scale vendor neutral efforts in the space
to educate, inform, and provide timely updates such that the community can make better
informed risk decisions with their capital and NFTs. This changes now.

RATIONALE
With BAYC holders being the largest target for hackers/scammers, the DAO will face
unique challenges over the coming months and years as it pertains to Security.
Bringing a whole slew of new users into DeFi primitives, they will face even more
challenges in ensuring the safety of their coins, NFTs, and digital assets more broadly.
As the ecosystem evolves and web3 integrations become more prevalent, getting a BAYC
holder to sign a potentially malicious transaction will be the holy grail of exploits,
and one that should concern this DAO greatly.

SPECIFICATIONS
Dune Analytics to help determine trends, track user behavior, and guide decisions of
resource allocation.
Social Media to conduct outreach, education, and
Smart Contract Review Tools - We hope to make partnerships with established auditing
companies in the space to give us the ability to do preliminary safety checks on minting
contracts, airdropped tokens, etc.

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT
After Funding is secured we plan to:

Setup Coordinape and fund it with a portion of our Apecoin each month. DAO participants
will be paid out every month, based on their effort into the DAO and the perceived value
of other contributors in the contributor bucket.
Hire (1) staff member out of a legal entity already created to facilitate this effort.
This staff member will be doing outreach, tracking attendance to courses, website content
updates, issuing our BS101 NFTs, coordinating volunteer activities, Coordinape payout
handling, and most importantly tracking our metrics and helping the group work towards
them, and potentially more depending on their skill set or desire.
Partnerships, Website design, Giveaways, Social Media blitzes, etc.
We believe with the ($80,000 worth of apecoin) we will be able to have a 6 month runway
of associated costs. Beer money for volunteers, a full-time staff member, and our
software needs. However, being able to up the volunteer budget or being able to pay
people for valuable contributions outside of coordinape to help us push our milestones
further, faster, is the goal. This is why we are requesting funding from multiple sources.

TIMELINE
2022 OKRs Summary:
Achieve a meaningful number members to join the Boring Security community
Funding to support Boring Security objectives long-term

Milestones

Security Educational Courses w/ POAP
Become the largest security communities in the NFT space.
Active monitoring, reviews, and tooling for the space.
Roadmap and Milestones

Phase 1
Summary: During phase 1 the team will be designing and developing Educational Courses
geared toward changing risky behavior in the NFT Space, eg. Blind Signing, risky
approvals, etc. The team will also accumulate and collect the necessary wallet, event,
asset, approval data to analyze and ruthlessly prioritize our roadmap.
Milestones: Courseware, POAPs, and establish DAO structure.

Create NFT security Educational courseware targeting High Risk individuals based on
behavioral analysis.
Promote courseware via social awareness and engagement with key NFT communities.
Incentivize courseware through POAP and collaborations with NFT projects (giveaways,
whitelist)
Establish the optimal team and organizational structure to achieve the goals of a
long-lasting public utility

Phase 2
Summary: In order to be successful in a Security project it is essential to make data
driven decisions that enable us to understand the likelihood and severity of attacks.
Milestones: Curate Content, Go public, Smart Contract Review, More volunteers

Response team deployment
Paced Launch of the project (Open Socials, Discord, Advertising Material)
Metrics developed to track % of ‘key projects’ that recommend newcomers to utilize
Boring Security

Phase 3
Summary: Operational Success - Growth
Milestones: Partnerships, Growth, Tools, Trust

Full-time active monitoring of the space, threats, and scams
Develop scope beyond courseware. Establish mechanisms for proactive and reactive
airdrop/smart contract reviews for user safety.
Develop tools, dashboards, technical primitives to protect the community
Partnerships with large projects, potential companies or other DAOs to help spread
awareness and bring NFTs safely to the masses.

OVERALL COST
The initial ask from the DAO is 6969 $ape coin, but Boring Security has some plans to
generate additional supporter funding through Supporter NFT issuance, other grant
applications (Opensea grant is pending) and others. However, there will likely be ongoing
requests for funding that we will likely come back to the DAO for additional funding,
and provide updates of our progress, etc.


Proposal Name: Bored Ape Gazette: Ape Coin Media/ BAYC News
Proposal Category: Ecosystem Fund Allocation

ABSTRACT
The Bored Ape Gazette has grown exponentially over the past year and we have covered
everything in the Bored Ape ecosystem since June 1,2021. I am committed to building a
trusted source of information for this community and I would like to expand the operations
into continuous research, analysis and reporting across the ecosystem. After speaking
with Brandon Caruana, I believe the best way for the Bored Ape Gazette to grow is via a
grant from the ApeCoin DAO.

We fully believe in the power and support of this community and would like to work for it
full time. We have a plan to turn the Bored Ape Gazette into a sustainable business model
over the course of one year and I am requesting a grant from the community to help me
accomplish this goal.

Motivation
The goal of the Bored Ape Gazette is to keep $Ape holders, BAYC members and the general
public informed on all things Ape! I have met some amazing people over the last year and
feel honored to be able to provide this community with a trusted source of information.

Rationale
The Bored Ape Gazette was founded on June 1, 2021 and has covered the BAYC and its
members every day since.

As the community has expanded from a 10,000 profile photo collection into a global brand
and DAO, the need for a trusted community news source has never been more important.

The Bored Ape Gazette has worked hard to become this trusted source of information and
can see a path to expand our presence and content. We will continue to support this
community faithfully.

Specifications
Over the next year, we believe that the Bored Ape Gazette will become the go to news
source for every member of this community. With the support of the DAO, the Bored Ape
Gazette website will become a 24-hour style news site complete with a live BAYC, MAYC,
BAKC and Otherdeed sales ticker, an $Ape price chart complete with a tradeview, a
calendar showing important dates such as DAO votes and other community related
events, a classifieds section where community members can list their BAYC/ Yuga related
art and services, among other resources that will keep the community and the world
informed on all things ape!

Along with an updated website, the Bored Ape Gazette will also work to keep the
community better informed on the ApeCoin DAO with bi- weekly newsletters and in depth
reports on Ape Improvement Proposals complete with Q&A interviews with the AIP Authors
and interviews with holders who are for and against the proposals.

Steps to Implement
To begin, I’d love to get DAO members help in revamping the Gazette and making it more
user friendly by adding community resources to the site.

Some of the resources I would like to add to the site are:
1.A live ticker showing sales from the BAYC, MAYC, BAKC and Otherdeed collections,
2.An Ape coin price chart
3.An Ape coin DAO tracker showing members what AIPs are on the ballot this week at the DAO.
4.An Ape Calendar showing upcoming community events, meetups and DAO votes
5. A classifieds section where members can sell their BAYC/ Yuga art and services in $Ape

Along with those improvements to the website, with the help of the DAO I will make
running the community newspaper my full time job and deliver more daily coverage.

For $7000 per month, I will ramp up my coverage of all things Ape with a focus on the
Apecoin DAO and I will create a bi-weekly newsletter for the community immediately.

Further, I will also edit contributing writers’ stories and lead weekly Bored Ape Gazette
writers meetings where all community members are welcome and everyone can pitch ideas and
get involved in the paper!

At this time, I would also like to extend an invite to any/all DAO members who want to
write/report to come join the Gazette! This is a community paper that should be written
by members of the $Ape community! I believe that the DAO should pay these reporters $100
dollars per published article.

In total, I expect the Gazette to cost the DAO an estimated $10,000 a month for news
coverage and an additional cost to revamp the website.

Timeline
The Bored Ape Gazette is positioned to begin implementing these steps immediately.
Once the DAO approves of this grant, coverage of all things ape will ramp up from 1-2
stories a day to 3-5. I also will host the first Bored Ape Gazette writers meeting a
week after the approval of this AIP.

On the second or fourth Tuesday of the month following the approval of this grant I will
release the first bi- weekly newsletter on the ApeCoin DAO. Going forward, these
newsletters will be released on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month. I believe
releasing these newsletters on Tuesday is critical so $Ape holders have a day to read
the news and vote before the Wednesday night deadline.

The updates to the Bored Ape Gazette website will begin immediately after the approval
of this grant. Brandon Caruana has agreed to help with this part. The website should be
transformed within a quarter.

Overall Cost

$150,000 USD for the first year.


ApeCoin DAO Handbook

This evolving guide is designed to help you navigate and understand the ApeCoin DAO.
Here’s what you can find:

1. Intro to DAO’s & The Ownership Economy
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), such as the ApeCoin DAO, represent a
revolutionary approach to organizational structure, powered by the transparency and
immutability of blockchain technology. DAOs operate on the principles of transparency,
inclusivity, and direct participation, providing a platform where every member has a
voice.

ApeCoin DAO is a prime example of the emerging ownership economy, where users are not
just passive consumers but active stakeholders. As holders of APE tokens, users have the
ability to influence the direction of the DAO, participating in decisions ranging from
governance policies to Ecosystem Fund Allocations. This level of involvement is a
significant departure from traditional organizational structures, fostering a sense of
community and shared purpose.

2. How DAO’s work
Blockchain technology is what allows DAOs to maintain the integrity of their governance
structures, proving the validity of consensus mechanisms on-chain. As the ApeCoin DAO
continues to decentralize and operate autonomously, smart contracts play an increasingly
important role.

These self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code
govern the proposal and execution processes within the DAO. They ensure that rules and
procedures are followed consistently, without the need for a central authority or
intermediary. Code automatically executes actions when certain conditions are met.

This could include releasing funds for a project once it has received sufficient votes or
vesting token unlocks into the Ecosystem Fund. By automating these processes, smart
contracts not only increase efficiency but also ensure fairness and transparency,
reinforcing the core principles of the ApeCoin DAO.

3. Learn about the benefits and challenges of DAO’s
ApeCoin DAO embodies the principles of collective ownership and democratized access to
resources and decision-making abilities for its community. It excels at coordinating and
incentivizing its diverse group of APE token holders towards common goals, such as
funding proposals that enhance the value of the ecosystem or supporting initiatives that
align with the DAO’s mission.

ApeCoin DAO enables direct participation in decision-making, fostering a sense of
ownership and engagement among its members. Moreover, ApeCoin DAO is effective at
managing and distributing resources in a transparent way. Through the proposal process,
resources are allocated based on community consensus. Each proposal undergoes a rigorous
review and voting process, ensuring that resources are directed towards initiatives that
have community support.

Aligning incentives is a critical aspect of ApeCoin DAO’s operations. The DAO could
potentially face a ‘tragedy of the commons’ scenario, where the lack of clear mandates
or tangible benefits might discourage members from taking ownership of tasks or
initiatives. To counteract this, ApeCoin DAO has implemented several community led
initiatives such as the Working Group structure implemented by AIP-239 as well as the
proposal process to incentivize active participation and ownership.

Efficiency challenges are a reality for the ApeCoin DAO, as they are for many
decentralized organizations. The need to achieve consensus among a diverse group of
APE token holders can sometimes slow down decision-making processes. However, this is
a feature, not a bug; ensuring that decisions reflect the collective will of the
community and are not dictated by a central authority.

Dispute resolution in the ApeCoin DAO is also a complex issue due to its decentralized
nature. However, the DAO is committed to transparency and fairness in all its
operations. Disputes related to proposals or decisions are addressed through open
discussion and voting, ensuring that all voices are heard and that the final decision
aligns with the majority’s view. Despite these challenges, ApeCoin DAO remains committed
to its principles of transparency, inclusivity, and direct participation, continually
seeking ways to improve its processes and structures.

4. What is the ApeCoin DAO?
ApeCoin DAO is a community-driven organization that operates on the principles of
decentralization and autonomy. Any APE token holders may propose an AIP, or APE
Improvement Proposal. The DAO will then deliberate, and vote on these initiatives which
impact the ApeCoin ecosystem. These AIPs often take the form of grants to incentivize
the community to build out the overall APE ecosystem.

5. Explore the Mission, Vision, and Values of the ApeCoin DAO
Mission Statement: Culture has found new expression in web3 through art, gaming,
entertainment, and events. The possibilities for blockchain’s impact on culture are so
endless that they can’t possibly all be predicted yet. APE is a token made to support
what’s next, controlled and built on by the community. It will serve as a decentralized
protocol layer for community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse

Vision: From ApeCoin.com 2: “Culture has found new expression in web3 through art,
gaming, entertainment, and events. The possibilities for blockchain’s impact on culture
are so endless that they can’t possibly all be predicted yet. APE is a token made to
support what’s next, controlled and built on by the community. It will serve as a
decentralized protocol layer for community-led initiatives that drive culture forward
into the metaverse.”

Values: The values of ApeCoin DAO are centered around community, transparency, and
innovation. The DAO believes in the power of community and the potential of every member
to contribute to the ecosystem. It values transparency in its operations and
decision-making processes, as evidenced by AIPs like AIP-121, which proposed a
transparency act for Ecosystem Fund Allocations.

Boldness: We don’t shy away from the weird, the hard, or the new.
Equality: One APE equals one APE.
Transparency: Processes and decisions are shared openly with the community.
Collective Responsibility: We leave everything better than we found it.
Persistence: Success is an ouroboros, not a straight line.

6. Learn about the DAO's structure and key roles
The ApeCoin DAO is structured as two parts of a larger whole. Similar to a ship and its
crew, we need both if we want to reach our destination.

The APE Foundation is like the ship itself - it’s the tangible, physical entity that
provides the structure, resources, and initial direction. It’s built with a specific
purpose in mind and is equipped with everything needed to achieve that purpose.

The DAO, on the other hand, is like the crew of the ship. They’re the ones who actually
operate the ship, making decisions about where to go, how to navigate, and what actions
to take. They’re not just passive passengers; they’re actively involved in steering the
ship, planning the route, and navigating the waters.

Just as a ship needs a crew to deliver its cargo, the APE Foundation needs the DAO to
bring its vision to life. And just as a crew needs a ship to embark on their journey,
the DAO needs the Foundation company to provide the framework and resources for their
governance processes.

7. Get insights into the Ape Foundation
Within the Foundation, and the DAO, there are various roles and entities, each with
their own responsibilities and functions. First, let’s dive into the APE Foundation.

The APE Foundation:
From ApeCoin.com/about: “The APE Foundation is the steward of ApeCoin. It is not an
overseer, but the base layer on which ApeCoin holders in the ApeCoin DAO can build.
The Foundation facilitates decentralized and community-led governance and is designed
to become more decentralized over time.”

The Foundation is tasked with administering the decisions of the ApeCoin DAO, and is
responsible for day-to-day administration, bookkeeping, project management, and other
tasks that ensure the DAO community’s ideas have the support they need to become a
reality.” - Apecoin.com

Special Council: The Special Council is a five-person elected group of DAO members who
provide oversight of the Foundation administrators. Members of the Special Council are
elected for one-year terms, with seats rotating up for election every six months for
terms starting in the months of January, and July. The process for nominating and
electing members to the Special Council is outlined in AIP-137 and AIP-138.

The Special Council is responsible for administering DAO proposals and serving the
vision of the community. They meet to discuss proposals requiring administrative
review under ApeCoin DAO rules, as approved in AIP-1 1.

AIP-282 has created a comprehensive description of the Special Council role.

The DAO Administrators:
In the ApeCoin DAO, members have the power to influence the direction of the ecosystem
through their votes. However, the Foundation, as a legal entity, still plays a crucial
role. It’s the engine room of the ship, ensuring that the DAO’s decisions are
implemented and the day-to-day operations run smoothly. The Foundation’s
responsibilities encompass administering the DAO’s decisions, and managing daily tasks
like bookkeeping, grant disbursement, and project management. This ensures that the
innovative ideas from our community have the necessary support to come to life.

The DAO Administrators were originally engaged for a specific scope as ratified in
AIP-1 1, including:
To provide operational support and project management support for the Foundation;
To act as the team of moderators, administrators, and lead in Discourse;
To act as the team of reviewers to prepare reports and any other supporting documentation
necessary; and
Manage Discourse and Snapshot.

The Request for Proposal process carried out by Working Group Zero, from AIP-196, in
addition to the Working Group Guidelines proposal from AIP-239, have adjusted this scope
slightly to several administrative support categories including:

Compliance and Legal: The DAO Administrators assist with ensuring legal and regulatory
compliance of the APE Foundation under applicable law. They also facilitate the legal
processes with respect to APE Foundation activities as determined by the Director,
Supervisor, and Special Council including but not limited to: Vendor Contracts, Grant
Due Diligence, Grant Agreements, and Trademarks.

Finance: They are also responsible for administering the APE Foundation’s finances as
determined by the Director, Supervisor, and Special Council including but not limited
to: Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Bookkeeping and Financial Reporting.

Operations: The DAO Administrators also facilitate weekly Special Council meetings,
apply and adhere to AIP guidelines, administer and maintain social media accounts, and
publish content to said accounts as directed by the DAO working group(s), maintain and
update the ApeCoin website and maintain the Discourse Enterprise Account, as well as
maintain @apecoin email addresses and answer or forward incoming email to relevant
parties as necessary.

Treasury: Our DAO Administrators also facilitate the administration of the APE
Foundation Treasury, including but not limited to: counterparty risk mitigation,
custodian account management, facilitating OTC sales of ApeCoin, facilitating SAFE
Multisig usage, maintaining addresses to hold apecoin.eth ENS & the ApeCoin NFT.

The ApeCoin DAO selected our current DAO Administrators, WebSlinger, through a
snapshot vote.

8. Learn about ApeCoin DAO Working Groups
AIP-239 ratified a process for creating community-led infrastructure, called Working
Groups, for the ApeCoin DAO. The primary motivation for having Working Groups to
facilitate DAO operations is to prevent a single point of failure, while decentralizing
DAO operations into the hands of the community. Working Groups enable a sustainable
infrastructure which allows the DAO to operate efficiently while adapting to any
challenges.

Working groups can be formed within the DAO, each with its own charter and elected
members. These groups focus on specific areas such as Governance, Metaverse and
Marketing & Communications, as per AIP-239, AIP-245, and AIP-246. Working Groups are
intentional community-led infrastructure, which allow for the execution of DAO-approved
mandates. Working Group Charters outline a mandate for a Working Group, which must
align with the vision and values of the ApeCoin DAO. A Working Group Charter consists of:

Mandate and Scope - What does this group do?
OKRs, if any - How is progress measured against budget proposals?
Initiatives, if any - Which specific tasks or teams does this group need?
Reporting Requirements - How often will this group report to the DAO?
Stewards, if any - Who will maintain this group until the next election?
Budget - How much will this cost until the next Funding Window? (Can be $0)

Any DAO member may propose a new Working Group. If the proposed Charter is approved by
the DAO, an election will be held to select the 3 Stewards who will manage their Working
Group until the next election cycle.

Working Group Stewards are elected on a rotating seat basis every six months, similar to
the Special Council. They are responsible for supervising the operations of their Working
Group, taking custody of a budget into their multisig, and paying their individual
contributors. The responsibilities of Stewards include, but are not limited to:

Managing their Working Group multisig;
Operational tasks related to the administration of their Working Group;
Maintaining relevant documents and their Working Group Charter;
Creating, implementing and managing initiatives within a Working Group
Communicating and coordinating with the APE Foundation Administrators, Special Council
and the DAO Secretary;
Approving budgets for Initiatives and contributors;
Executing on the mandate in their Working Group Charter.

Note: Stewards are responsible for facilitating the will of the DAO. Stewards of Working
Groups can be mandated to perform tasks, set objectives and goals, sign documents and
enter into agreements pending the outcome of our governance process, or an AIP.

Note: Stewards are directly responsible for their Initiatives. These are teams that have
been delegated responsibility from a Working Group to perform a specific task or tasks.
This means Stewards can create and terminate Initiatives as needed. If a specific
Initiative is not meaningfully contributing towards the fulfillment of the Working
Group’s Mandate, the Initiative needs to be adjusted, reworked, edited, or otherwise
removed.

Working Group Budgets:

Working Groups propose a budget to the DAO every six months, within the months of
February and August, in order to fund the operations of their Working Group. Stewards
of a Working Group shall have the discretion to allocate their own Working Group funds
where appropriate and where it is not illegal or in conflict with any AIPs or other rules.

Working Group Multisigs & ENS Names:

Each working Group has three Stewards which, together with the DAO Secretary, make up the
signers on their multisigs. Each Working Group Multisig is a 3/4 requiring all three
Stewards, or two Stewards and the Secretary, to approve transactions.

The Governance Working Group Multisig can be found here:
GnosisSafeProxy | Address 0x3b319DeF689F90f9dC406c163434DF31b06d0fc2 | Etherscan

9. The Governance Working Group Stewards, Discourse Facilitators and the DAO Secretary
The Governance Working Group is the ApeCoin DAO’s first Working Group approved in AIP-239.
The Governance Working Group’s mandate is to provide neutral and objective governance
oversight and support for the operations of the ApeCoin DAO. It was designed specifically
to reduce the scope of our DAO Administrators from facilitating the entirety of our
governance process, from AIP-1.

The Governance Working Group Stewards are responsible for:

Providing operational support and project management support for the Foundation;
Coordinating the team of moderators, administrators, and lead in Discourse;
Assisting with transitioning of Foundation service providers;
Creating and maintaining policies and procedures as they relate to governance;
Maintaining operations and supporting governance Initiatives like the Ape Assembly and
the DAO Secretary;
Assisting with facilitating the Special Council Election Process as outlined in AIP-137:
The Special Council Nomination Process, and AIP-138: The Special Council Election Process.

The Governance Working Group has several Initiatives, or teams, with which to fulfill
the mandate in their Charter:

Community Discourse Facilitators
Community Discourse Facilitators are responsible for moderating and facilitating
discussions within the ApeCoin DAO community, as per AIP-240 1. The Discourse Facilitator
team is responsible for several tasks on our governance forum, including:

Reviewing new users’ profiles and posts to Discourse;
Troubleshooting user profile issues;
Coordinating with authors to move AIPs through the pipeline and informing the community
of these updates according to DAO approved guidelines;
Creating Draft Analysis Reports (DARs), including a series of questions to authors,
for Administrative Review;
Coordinating an AIP Status Board via a Project Management Tool;
Coordinating amongst themselves as Facilitators;
Coordinating with the APE Foundation Administration Team.
DAO Secretary

The DAO Secretary ensures the smooth operation of the DAO. They manage the proposal
process, coordinate with other DAO members and working groups, and ensure that the
DAO’s rules and procedures are followed. The DAO Secretary is responsible for:

Managing a DAO-wide calendar;
Managing a DAO-wide organization chart;
Publishing a monthly ApeCoin DAO Transparency Report;
Publishing an annual ApeCoin DAO Progress Report;
Attending at least one weekly meeting with each Working Group;
Ensuring meeting summaries are posted in the governance forum;
Attending at least one meeting weekly with each Working Group where possible;
Assisting Stewards with coordination challenges within Working Groups;
Participating in a bi-weekly coordination call, held with the Leads from each Working
Group, to align broader DAO strategy;
Acting as a multisig signer for Working Groups.

The Ape Assembly

The Ape Assembly is an electorate of highly active governance participants in the ApeCoin
Ecosystem. They are tasked with facilitating the elections for all the Working Group
Stewards with the exception of Governance Stewards. The Ape Assembly is responsible for:

Facilitating Working Group Steward elections
Determining the term length of the DAO Secretary
Meeting regularly to discuss DAO-wide issues and collectively write AIPs to address them
Focused on governance, coordination and transparency within the DAO

10. Learn about APE token holders, and their role in the DAO

ApeCoin Token Holders are not just passive participants in the ApeCoin ecosystem -
they’re an integral part of the ApeCoin DAO. With the power to propose initiatives,
engage in meaningful discussions, and cast votes on key proposals, token holders play a
crucial role in the decision-making process.

11. DAO Processes
The ApeCoin DAO operates through a series of processes, including proposal creation,
discussion, voting, and implementation. The proposal process allows any member to propose
an initiative or change. Once a proposal is made, it is open for discussion by the
community. After the discussion period, the proposal is put to a vote. If the proposal is
approved by the community, it is then implemented by either the Working Groups, or the
DAO Administrators.

12. Dive into the ApeCoin DAO proposal process
Any DAO member can create a proposal which is then discussed and voted on by the
community. A new proposal can be vague, a simple idea, but for it to go to vote it needs
to follow the AIP Draft Template.

Proposals can cover a wide range of topics, from changes to the DAO’s operations to new
initiatives for the ApeCoin ecosystem.

The Proposal Process is detailed in AIP-1

13. Learn about our voting process, and how consensus is found
Voting is a crucial part of the DAO process. DAO members can vote on proposals, elect
Special Council members or Working Group Stewards, and make other key decisions impacting
the operations of the DAO. Voting is conducted in a transparent and democratic manner on
Snapshot, with 1 APE token = 1 VOTE. AIPs go up for vote every Thursday at 9PM EST, and
continue until the following Wednesday at 9PM EST.

The Voting Process is detailed in AIP-2 and AIP-200.

14. Learn about voter delegation and its significance
Voter delegation allows DAO members to delegate their voting power to others, without
losing control or access to their tokens. Delegation is a powerful tool that can increase
participation in the DAO and ensure that all members’ interests are represented.

AIP-89 created a delegate dashboard for the ApeCoin DAO to better understand their token
holders and delegations. The ApeCoin DAO relies on its delegations to ensure the
integrity and validity of our consensus mechanisms.

The ApeCoin delegation dashboard can be found here: delegate.apecoin.com

15. The AIP Process, start to finish
Our proposal process follows several “Phases,” as detailed in AIP-1.

In Phase 1: Community members submit new ideas for approval, discussion, or rejection.
A Discourse Facilitator, guided by DAO-approved guidelines, reviews each submission.
Ideas can range from detailed proposals to simple suggestions beneficial to the DAO.
Once an idea has been submitted and approved on the forums, the community will have seven
days to discuss the proposal and add their feedback for the author.

In Phase 2: Once the author is ready to continue to the AIP Draft phase, they will be
requested to edit their Topic in the AIP Ideas category, using the AIP Draft Template
to include any changes/feedback from the community. Completed AIP Drafts, that comply
with the Guidelines, are then moved from the AIP Ideas category to the appropriate
subcategory of the AIP Drafts parent category, and reopened.

In Phase 3: Once the AIP Draft is received, the AIP moves to the Analysis Report phase.
The AIP Draft is reviewed by a project management team engaged by APE Foundation, who
will provide an in-depth AIP Draft Analysis Report, or DAR. The purpose of the DAR is
to ensure that all costs, steps to implement, legal considerations, third-party review
requirements, potential conflicts of interests, and any further implications have been
properly considered and identified prior to a vote.

In Phase 4: The DAR package is reviewed, and if the AIP is complying with DAO-approved
guidelines, it becomes a Pending AIP and moves to Phase 5. If a DAR package fails to
comply with DAO-approved guidelines, it is eligible for resubmission unless in cases
of violation of the law or reasonable suspicion of fraud or other misleading information.

In Phase 5: AIPs that have passed AIP Moderation will then either be tagged as “Straight
to Vote” or “Needs Administrative Review.” The “Straight to Vote” tag is for any AIP with
costs, content, and implications considered to be straightforward and of no risk to the
well-being of the DAO. The “Needs Administrative Review” tag is given for any pending
AIP whose costs, content, or implications are considered to be complicated or a potential
risk to the well-being of the DAO.

In Phase 6: The Special Council will review AIPs in the Administrative Review category.
The Special Council is responsible for ensuring that the costs, content, and implications
in AIPs are clear before they are put up for a vote.

In Phase 7: Drafts that have passed their respective approval processes will become a
Live AIP on Snapshot during the next Weekly AIP Release, which is when new AIPs are
released in batches every Thursday at 9PM EST. AIPs will be Live on Snapshot until the
following Wednesday at 9PM EST.

In Phase 8: After the vote on Snapshot has concluded, the AIP will be moved to the
Final AIP category on the forums. There are two subcategories for the Final AIP status:
accepted and rejected. Rejected Final AIPs will have the chance to be resubmitted via
the appropriate Resubmission Template if the author contacts a moderator to initiate
this process. Accepted Final AIPs will move into implementation, or Phase 9.

In Phase 9: Final AIPs which have been accepted by the DAO will be implemented.
The project management team engaged by the APE Foundation is responsible for making sure
this happens but not responsible for doing it themselves.

16. ApeCoin tokenomics & allocations
The total supply of ApeCoin is permanently fixed at 1 billion tokens. There is no minting
capability in the contract, thus the total supply will never increase. Similarly, the
contract interface does not expose any token burning capability. ApeCoin was allocated at
launch to BAYC/MAYC NFT holders, the ApeCoin DAO Ecosystem Fund, Yuga Labs, the BAYC
Founders, other launch contributors, and charity.

In line with the standard practice, a portion of the tokens released are initially
locked. Locked tokens will be unlocked over a period of 48 months, in accordance with the
predetermined unlock schedule below, starting on launch day, March 17, 2022.

The initial distribution of Apecoin (APE) tokens is as follows:
14.00% is allocated to Launch Contributors
15.00% is allocated to BAYC/MAYC NFT Holders
47.00% is allocated to Treasury/Resources
15.00% is allocated to Yuga Labs
1.00% is allocated to Charity (JGLF)
8.00% is allocated to BAYC Founders

17. Learn about ApeCoin staking and how it impacts token holders
As a first step to ApeCoin becoming the preferred token of web3, early NFT adopters and
existing and potential ecosystem participants are incentivized.

ApeCoin staking was proposed around incentivizing existing and potential holders to
engage in the ecosystem, one of several ways additional utility has been added to ApeCoin
and the BAYC ecosystem NFTs which participate in the ApeCoin DAO.

17.5% of the total ApeCoin supply is to be distributed over the Total Staking Period of
three (3) years. This is funded by the Ecosystem Fund. Staking participants are able to
stake ApeCoin and use the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem NFTs to receive ApeCoin from the
staking pool.

There are a total of four ways to stake ApeCoin, each with predefined caps. These four
staking methods are:

BAYC NFT Staking:
47,105,000 ApeCoin Tokens allocated for 3 years, capped at 10,094 staked ApeCoin per
BAYC NFT.

MAYC NFT Staking:
19,060,000 ApeCoin Tokens allocated for 3 years, capped at 2,042 staked ApeCoin per MAYC
NFT.

BAKC Paired NFT Staking:
3,835,000 ApeCoin Tokens allocated for 3 years, capped at 856 staked ApeCoin per paired
NFT.

ApeCoin Staking:
30,000,000 ApeCoin Tokens allocated for 3 years, with no cap on staked ApeCoin.

The total staking periods for ApeCoin are as follows:

Year One: 100,000,000 ApeCoin tokens (10.0% of the total ApeCoin supply)
Year Two: 50,000,000 ApeCoin tokens (5.0% of the total ApeCoin supply)
Year Three: 25,000,000 ApeCoin tokens (2.5% of the total ApeCoin supply)

The staking process is explained in AIP-21 and AIP-22.

This is the staking contract: 0x5954aB967Bc958940b7EB73ee84797Dc8a2AFbb9

AIP-64: APE Coin Festival - Bringing NFT Communities Together
Author: ssp1111

Proposal Name: Feasibility Study for Web3 Village (an NFT Conference & Festival)

Proposal Category: Branding, Marketing, IRL Events

Abstract:
This proposal is for a Feasibility Study ONLY (not an actual event)
This proposal is based on our collective experiences at NFT-nyc and the countless
requests for a “better” NFT conference/festival
This proposal is NOT a substitute for ApeFest – YUGA will do their own thing for their
communities
This AIP is proposing to do the legwork to secure letters of interest from various NFT
Communities, Brands, Sponsors, Venues and Event Cos BEFORE drafting a separate proposal
for putting together a DAO-Owned and Managed Conference & Festival - aka Web3 Village

Motivation:
As NFT-NYC showed this past week, IRL events are a great way to bring online
communities together.
Further, it was clear as day that if all the satellite events joined up to create a space
where attendees could walk from project to project, where combined resources would save
major $$$ while elevating activations, and where a master calendar would help avoid
scheduling conflicts, the effort would be well received

Rationale
The APE Coin DAO is all about bringing NFT communities together and onboarding newcomers
to the space.
As NFT-NYC showed this past week, IRL events are a great way to accomplish both. And
while there are countless ideas floating around for a better NFT event, it would be fire
:fire: if the APE Coin DAO was the foundation on which this flagship event and combined
ideas were built upon

Key Terms:
Web3 Village = General concept and working name for our NFT Conference & Festival
Feasibility Study = gathering resources, contacts, venues, producers, brands, sponsors,
etc, aggregating feedback and converting to actionable data*

Specifications:
Landing Page
Airtable
Phone

Steps to Implement:
Get this proposal approved along with an APE Coin DAO “Stamp of Approval”
Work with Graphic Designer for visual collateral and social media assets ≈ $2.5k
Set-up Landing Page - executed by author at zero cost or with professional designer ≈ $2.5k
Set-up Airtable - executed by author at zero cost
Begin campaign of reaching out to Web3 attendees, activations, brands, sponsors, venues
and talent - author and volunteers at zero cost – with paid VA’s ≈ $5k

Timeline:
July - AIP drafts, rewrites, feedback, approval
August - Create collateral and begin outreach campaign
September - Aggregate content and actionable data in the form of a Pitch Deck and AIP for
APE Coin DAO to consider and vote upon
Overall Cost:

Sub $10k
PS - Author receives zero $$ from this proposal - but happy to continue leading the Web3
Village AIP


Proposal Name: Extending AIP-1 - the DAO Process
Proposal Category: Process

ABSTRACT
The DAO’s operations rely on the Ape Foundation, which serves as a steward for ApeCoin by
empowering the community to lead the DAO and helping to execute its vision. The terms of
the Foundation’s relationship with the DAO were established on a six-month basis in
AIP-1. That six-month period will conclude on September 30, and absent any alternative
process for continuing the DAO’s operations, will bring with it the risk that the DAO
falls into a vulnerable period during which it lacks actionable operational procedures.
This AIP proposes a three-month extension of the terms laid out in AIP-1 to (1) provide
time for the development of a proper and thorough Ape Foundation election framework and
process; (2) allow the community to better understand and ultimately engage with whatever
process emerges; and (3) enable the DAO to continue functioning coherently beyond
September 30.

MOTIVATION
The DAO in its current state relies on the Ape Foundation to operate. September 30 will
mark six months since the launch of the ApeCoin DAO, and with it will come an end to the
six-month terms of the Ape Foundation Special Council and Administration established in
AIP-1. The lack to-date of a community AIP on elections confirms that the election
process as written in the governance materials is ambiguous and lacks sufficient detail.
This AIP gives the community extra time to develop and agree to a thoughtful and
comprehensive election framework, and ensure the DAO continues to run smoothly.

RATIONALE
A three-month extension of the terms laid out in AIP-1 will accomplish two main goals.
An extension will provide continuity and stability: the Foundation doesn’t just execute
what the community wants - it enables us to ensure we are compliant with the necessary
legal, regulatory, and compliance laws and guidance so we can operate effectively.
Second, the extension will allow the community to better understand, contribute to, and
ultimately engage with whatever election process emerges.

SPECIFICATIONS
Extend the terms laid out in AIP-1 by a period of 3 months.

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT
This AIP will go through the same approval process as all other AIPs. It will start as
an AIP Idea that is open for a 7-day comment period. A proposal will then be drafted
for further analysis, and it will go to the Special Council for review and finally the
community will vote on it via Snapshot.

If this AIP is passed, the terms laid out in AIP-1 will be extended by 3 months.

TIMELINE
If passed, this AIP would go into effect for 3 months immediately following the term laid
out in AIP-1 and beginning on October 1st.

COSTS
This AIP would continue the monthly recurring costs laid out in AIP-1.


Proposal Name: Ape&Talent - Platform to connect talent within the Ape community

Proposal Category: Ecosystem Fund Allocation

Abstracts
One of the perks of being an Ape is belonging to one of the strongest communities within
the Web3 world but sometimes it’s hard to communicate what you can do for the community
or what the community can do for you. This AIP proposes the creation of a platform that
facilitates the connection of talent/needs between the Ape community: BAYC, MAYC, BAKC
and ApeCoin holders.

Motivation
One of the best places to be, being an Ape, is on the official Discord channel. I have
been belonging to MAYC for 10 months, since then I have collaborated on several projects
and helped several apes in the fields that I have more knowledge (15 years Software
engineering: Blockchain security, image processing, dapps development…). Whenever I see
that someone needs help with any of these fields, I offer my services on Discord but
this information is ephemeral and lost in time (people do not usually use Discord
history since an immediate interaction is expected). The downside is if you’re very
active on Discord, this can be spam about you and Discord becomes not an optimal site
for it.

A few weeks ago, an Ape needed a higher resolution of his PFP for merch using his MAYC,
when offering me on Discord, another Ape said that days before he hired an external
person to do that job for him, if he had known, he would have preferred to contact
someone within the Ape community and I quote you what he said “I’d rather invest into
someone who is in a project im in rather than paying someone i’ve never had contact
with…keep it in the family so to speak”. This was the seed of the creation of this AIP.

In summary, it’s a marketplace (platform) where the Apes will be able to include their
talents or what fields they have experience and believe they can help to the community
but on the other side, instead of being businesses/agencies, they will be the Apes
themselves.

Examples:
You are a Bored who is going to start a fast food business and you need someone to help
you with the design of the advertising posters or a developer to help you with the
creation of a website.

You are a Mutant and you would like to give your partner a gift for his birthday with a
painting (or any type of physical merch) of his beloved BAKC and you don’t know where
to go.

You are a BAKC holder and you have heard that there are ways to improve the security of
your wallets but you do not know where to start or you have some doubts and you would
love someone you trust (advisor) to help you.

You are an ApeCoin holder and you want to take a trip to Europe but you don’t know
anyone to advise you on such a trip because it is your first time on the continent.

Rationale
There is a lot of talent within the Ape community but unless you are very active on
Discord or have thousands of Twitter followers, it can be difficult to get your talent
noticed within the community and strengthen internal connections within ApeCoin and
BAYC ecosystem NFTs.

Specifications
For the build of this platform, the team will be composed of

UI Designer
Frontend Engineer
Backend Engineer (me)

And we’ll use these technologies:

NodeJS
TypeScript
React
MongoDB
Terraform
Nextjs

This platform only can be accesible for the holders of:

BAYC
MAYC
BAKC
ApeCoin

For ApeCoin holders, a minimum amount will be defined to avoid spam and increase the
security. This amount is yet to be defined (500-800 $APE) but will be updated
periodically as the market grows or declines.

Steps to Implement
Although we have great ideas for the future: development of apps, smart notifications,
messaging, highlighted content… etc (their development would be approved or not in
future AIPs, we want to develop it together with the community). The team is focused on
delivery, so our first version will include the following features:

Search → The user will be able to find any member of the Ape community that matches their
search

Detail → Detail of a member’s profile in which you can see which are the fields in which
you can offer his services, previous experiences, comments from other users (reviews)…

Login → The login is tokengated and there will be a gas-less signature required. Each
account will be associated with the Ethereum address that we have logged in and must
contain one of the assets described above (otherwise the login will not be possible).

Profile → Place where the connected user will be able to update all their info and some
of them will be indexed to be used in the search process. Some of the information you can
update is your social networks, previous jobs that validate your experience, uploading
files with examples like artworks… etc.

Reviews → There will be a review system in which you can see previous work with other
Apes (and their feedback). When a talent is requested, the Ape receiving the help will
be able to leave a comment about it.

We’ll have a public Trello dashboard to show to everyone how the process is going and
we’ll open a beta to share our progress and get feedback from the community as we build.

Timeline
The estimated time frame is 3-4 months until the final 1.0 version is ready.

Overall Cost
If finally the funding is secured, 23,000 ApeCoin will be reserved. When the final
version (1.0) is published and ready, this reserved fund will be sent to our wallet,
we will only receive the funds once we deliver the final version to the community
(focused on delivery).

The funds obtained in this AIP will provide us with enough help to finance the
development of the project bases (1.0), fixing possible bugs in the future/minor updates,
help center and maintenance costs in the time window of a year since the platform is
ready in production (4 months + 12 months).


Proposal Name: Provide ApeCoin Brand Assets for AIP-96

Proposal Category: Core: Brand Decision

Abstract
In order to fully represent the ApeCoin DAO at the upcoming ETH San Francisco Hackathon2,
we (@maariab. @ssp1111, @Halina.eth, @Lost @Amplify, and others) are requesting usage of
the ApeCoin Logo for promotional materials for an IRL sponsorship table at the event.
Some items include, but are not limited to, an ApeCoin tablecloth, an ApeCoin banner, and
ApeCoin swag.

Motivation
Now that AIP-96 has passed, 9 we will be participating in the upcoming ETHGlobal
Hackathon, ETH SF, in November. We require access to the ApeCoin brand in order to fully
represent the DAO during the event.

Rationale
This AIP allows members of the ApeCoin DAO to use the ApeCoin brand assets for
promotional purposes for live and online events.

Specifications
None

Steps to Implement
If this AIP passes, we will use the ApeCoin Logo to create swag items and branding
resources for the hackathon sponsorship table. No items will be sold, no profits will be
earned, and no funding is requested in this AIP.

Additionally, we will create a package of generic assets & promotional materials that can
be used by members of the ApeCoin DAO for in-person and online events, provided that
these materials are used for promotional purposes only. This marketing and promotional
package can only be used for non-profitable causes.

Timeline
ASAP

Overall Cost
There is no cost to the DAO


AIP-138: The Special Council Election Process
Proposal Category: Process

Abstract
Two or three sentences that summarize the proposal.

This AIP establishes an election process for the Special Council. The proposed process
aims to ensure that all candidates have an equal and fair opportunity to be nominated
for the ApeCoin Special Council Election.

Motivation
A statement on why the APE Community should implement the proposal.

To advance the ApeCoin DAO’s path to decentralization, an election process that enables
qualified community members to serve in the DAO’s leadership is required. This AIP covers
the most essential pieces of that process. It aims to build critical infrastructure from
which the DAO can grow.

Rationale
An explanation of how the proposal aligns with the APE Community’s mission and guiding
values.

The long-term health of the ApeCoin DAO depends on a well-functioning nomination and
election process for the Special Council. This AIP consolidates much of the great
thinking the community has already put forth on this subject. That thinking is reflected
below in the proposed specifications, as well as in the following guiding principles for
writing this AIP:

Focusing on the essentials, knowing that more nice-to-have yet complex additions (e.g.,
reporting requirements, gamified participation, working groups/subDAOs, complex
vote-weighting techniques) can be addressed via follow-on AIPs at a later date.
By keeping things simple, the likelihood of consensus can be enhanced while also
decreasing risks like gridlock.
Balancing stability and fluidity, recognizing that some continuity from one term to the
next helps to maintain steady progress, while at the same time valuing the periodic
cycling in of new members and ideas.
Favor the tried and tested where there is not an obvious reason for doing otherwise –
this will limit the amount of complementary infrastructure that needs to be built and
new platforms the community will need to learn, which could reduce participation.

Key Terms
Definitions of any terms within the proposal that are unique to the proposal, new to the
APE Community, and/or industry-specific.

Candidate: Candidates are the Nominees that become eligible for the elections process.

The Special Council Nomination Process: The AIP that establishes a nomination process for
the Special Council.

Specifications
A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.

Special Council Seats
If this AIP passes, this is intended to occur one-time to determine which seats are up
for election at the election cycles.
Seat numbers will be assigned to existing Special Council members. These seat numbers
will be from 1 to 5.

Election Cycles
Timing and cadence of elections: Elections shall occur every 6 months.
Nomination and election to occur over November & December; elected Special Council
member(s) to start in January (“Cycle One”)
Nomination and election to occur over May & June; elected Special Council member(s) to
start in July (“Cycle Two”)
The following seats will be up for election at these times:
Cycle One: Seats 1, 2, & 3
Cycle Two: Seats 4 & 5
Rationale: Succession planning is paramount. A twice-yearly staggered process helps to
maintain continuity for longer-term objectives and avoids a cataclysmic change wherein
every Special Council seat is up for re-election at once. This should be balanced against
the risk of low participation-rates from excessively frequent elections.

Election Terms & Limits
Term: Each seat is for one-year term.
Term limit: An existing Special Council member may nominate themselves for re-election
and be elected to the Special Council up to 2 terms in a row.
Following the term limit, the former Special Council member must wait at least 1 election
cycle prior to being able to nominate themselves for the Special Council. In other words,
if the term limit ended on Cycle One, the Special Council member may nominate themselves
for the next Cycle Two election.
Rationale: The one-year term-length was outlined in AIP-1. One-year term lengths allow
for a balance of long-term orientation while encouraging active participation from
Special Council members. A two-year term-limit affords ample time to steward long-term
projects and strategy in the event the community supports the member reaching the maximum
duration.

Election Vote on Snapshot
Candidates for Special Council are determined in The Special Council Nomination Process.
Candidate profiles will be in the Discourse category Special Council Elections > Election Candidates.
Voting will take place on Snapshot
Each Candidate will be an option on the Snapshot vote
Each ApeCoin DAO member can only select one Candidate and that Candidate will receive all
of such ApeCoin DAO member’s voting power
An ApeCoin DAO member who has delegated their votes to another member may cast a vote
themselves and override the delegated vote
The vote will be released at the Weekly AIP Release and will close at the following
Weekly Voting Close
No other AIPs will go up for vote at this Weekly AIP Release, and all approved AIPs for
vote will be released at the following Weekly AIP Release
The top 3 voted Candidates in Cycle One and top 2 voted Candidates in Cycle Two shall be
elected to the Special Council, subject to adjustments from off-cycle departures or lack
of Candidates.

Off-Cycle Departures
In the event of the voluntary or involuntary departure of a Special Council member, that
seat will be incorporated into the upcoming election cycle, after which it will return to
the same election cycle schedule that it would have been on if the departing member had
remained.
Any partial terms for a Special Council member from off-cycle departures will not be
counted towards the term limit. For example, if a Special Council seat is in Cycle One
but a Candidate is elected to replace the Special Council member in Cycle Two, then the 6
months served by the newly elected Special Council member will not count towards the term limit.
Steps to Implement
The steps to implement the proposal, including associated costs, manpower, and other
resources for each step where applicable.

• A nomination process is required to determine the Candidates eligible for election, as
described in The Special Council Nomination Process.
• Candidates will be placed in the appropriate Discourse category, Election Candidates.
• Each Special Council member will be assigned a seat number.
• A Snapshot vote is created with the Candidates at the appropriate Weekly AIP Release.

Timeline
Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and
completion dates.

The first election shall take place in December, after The Special Council Nomination
Process occurs in November and December. Please see The Special Council Nomination
Process for estimated dates and timelines for the first nomination process.

If this AIP and The Special Council Nomination Process passes, then the estimated
Snapshot vote to determine Candidates will take place between Dec 15-21. As a result,
the Snapshot for election would be estimated to take place Dec 22-28.

Seat 1, 2, & 3 shall begin in January 2023.

Overall Cost
The total cost to implement the proposal.

There are no costs to implement this AIP.

Nonetheless, each Special Council member shall receive compensation as stated in AIP-1,
or $20,833 of ApeCoin equivalent per month for the term.


AIP-137: The Special Council Nomination Process
Proposal Category: Process

Abstract
Two or three sentences that summarize the proposal.

For the ApeCoin DAO to function and remain stable according to our Guiding Principles,
there must be a system in place for continuous governance. This document outlines the
process to allow talented, passionate and capable members of the community to surface
and ultimately be appointed via governance vote for the Special Council. The nomination
pool will be sourced through the community, administration team, and token holders by
self-nomination in ApeCoin discourse.

Motivation
A statement on why the APE Community should implement the proposal.

This AIP is primarily focused on the mechanics of how the nomination process will be
conducted. The goal of this process is to ensure that the community has a clear and
concise way to nominate Special Council members for elections that best represent the
interests of the community.

Rationale
An explanation of how the proposal aligns with the APE Community’s mission and guiding
values.

The long-term health of the ApeCoin DAO depends on a well-functioning nomination and
election process for the Special Council. This AIP consolidates much of the great
thinking the community has already put forth on this subject. That thinking is reflected
below in the proposed specifications, as well as in the following guiding principles for
writing this AIP:

Focusing on the essentials, knowing that more nice-to-have yet complex additions (e.g.,
reporting requirements, gamified participation, working groups/subDAOs, complex
vote-weighting techniques) can be addressed via follow-on AIPs at a later date.
By keeping things simple, the likelihood of consensus can be enhanced while also
decreasing risks like gridlock.
Balancing stability and fluidity, recognizing that some continuity from one term to the
next helps to maintain steady progress, while at the same time valuing the periodic
cycling in of new members and ideas.
Favor the tried and tested where there is not an obvious reason for doing otherwise –
this will limit the amount of complementary infrastructure that needs to be built and
new platforms the community will need to learn, which could reduce participation.

Key Terms
Definitions of any terms within the proposal that are unique to the proposal, new to the
APE Community, and/or industry-specific.

KYC: Know Your Customer (KYC) is the process of a business verifying the identity of its
customers. For the nomination process, KYC will ensure that candidates will not pose a
risk to the ApeCoin community and that they are not involved in any sanction list,
sanctioned country, or business.

Nomination Announcement: A nomination announcement is a topic posted in Discourse that
signifies the beginning of a nomination and election process. The nomination announcement
shall include details about the process, timeline and relevant dates, the application and
candidate process, and any other relevant details for the community.

Applicant: An applicant is any person who submits an application.

Nominee: A nominee is an Applicant that has submitted an application and completed the
KYC and background verification process.

Candidate: Candidates are the Nominees that become eligible for the elections process.

The Special Council Election Process: The AIP that establishes an election process for
the Special Council.

Specifications
A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.

The nomination process will start from a Nomination Announcement from the Ape Foundation.
A new category will be added to Discourse to accommodate the nomination and election
process. This category will be named “Special Council Elections” and will have four
sub-categories:

Announcements
Special Council Nominees
Election Candidates
Rejected/Withdrawn Nominations
The Nomination Announcement will be a new topic posted in the Discourse category Special
Council Elections > Announcements. The Nomination Announcement will include the
following details:

Details about the nomination and election process
Timeline for the nomination and election process
Application and candidate process
How to apply

The Nomination Announcement will be posted at least 50 days before the voting of the
election occurs and will mark the commencement of Special Council nomination process. A
link to a form will be included in the Nomination Announcement and applicants will
complete the form to submit their application.

Experience & Expectations of Applicants
Elected Special Council members are expected to attend weekly, or on an as-needed basis,
council meetings, review AIPs at meetings or by email, and commit 3 or more hours per
week or as sufficient time as needed to the role. A standard non-disclosure agreement
shall be entered into with the Ape Foundation and KYC documents shall be collected as
well.

Given that a key function of Special Council members is to work with and assess AIPs and
their authors, it would be beneficial if then Applicant’s skills, knowledge and
abilities are collectively suited to the AIP categories. Below are listed the AIP
categories, along with the types of competencies and experiences that would suggest a
candidate has expertise relevant to that particular category.

Ecosystem Fund Allocation: Since Ecosystem Fund AIPs deal with how to use the DAO’s
treasury funds, it would be ideal for a Special Council member to have:
Educational and/or professional credentials in accounting, finance, business, economics
or a related discipline;
Proven experience working in/managing/directing large corporations; and
Exposure to virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.
Brand Decision & Informational: Given that Brand Decision and Informational AIPs deal
with all matters related to what the DAO attaches its name, including projects,
strategies, and identity, it would be ideal for a Special Council member to have:
Educational and/or professional credentials in marketing, public relations, and/or a
related discipline;
Proven experience working in/managing/directing large corporations;
An entrepreneurial mindset;
Excellent communication and writing skills; and
Exposure to virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.
Process: Given that Process AIPs deal with DAO governance, it would be ideal for a
Special Council member to have:
Educational and/or professional credentials in law, politics, policy and/or corporate
governance;
Excellent communication and writing skills; and
Exposure to virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.

Phase 1 – Application and Verification – 21 days
In this phase, Applicants will be invited to put themselves forward for the Special
Council. In the Nomination Announcement, a link to a form will be provided for Applicants
to submit the following information:

Applicant Information: The Ape Foundation is a legal entity that must collect information
and documents for KYC purposes. The information provided below shall remain confidential,
or made public with the nomination profile at the option of the Applicant.

collect supporting or verification documents. All documents will remain secure and
private with the Ape Foundation.
Valid passport
Proof of address: A utility bill or bank statement in the name of the Applicant within
the last 3 months.

Nomination profile: The Applicant completes the nomination profile to build their case
to the community on why they are the best suited for the Special Council and to further
support the growth of the ApeCoin DAO. This nomination profile will be published on
the Discourse.
Nomination statement: concise statement on why you are running for Special Council
Motivation: please provide details on your motivation for being an ApeCoin DAO Special
Council member
Rationale: do you have any previous experience that is relevant to the role of a Special
Council member? Please discuss any skills relevant to this position and how these will
bring value to the ApeCoin community
Specifications: crypto governance participation, governance experience, previous
experience (work or education), and/or ideas for DAO improvement
Concluding statement: summarize your statement as to why you are the best choice for
Special Council

All information denoted as private will be treated as confidential. The application will
be open for 14 days. Special Council members whose seats are up for election must also
go through the nomination and election process to be considered.

Once the Applicant submits their information and nomination profile, a KYC and background
verification process shall take place to verify the information submitted. The Ape
Foundation may engage an independent, third-party service provider to complete this
process. This process may take up to 7 days.

At any time, an Applicant can request to withdraw their application by email.

Phase 2 – Community Discussions – 14 days

Applicants that pass the KYC and background verification process are Nominees. A new
topic for each Nominee will be posted under the new Discourse category Special Council
Elections > Special Council Nominees. This topic will be created by the administration
team and will include the following information:

Title: The title will include the Discourse ID and nomination cycle or time period;
Applicant information: All details that are public or selected to be posted as public
by the Nominee shall be included in the topic; and
Nomination profile: All details and information of the Nominee will be included in the
topic.

Topics in this category will be locked for editing but will be open for comments for 14
days. The community will be required to follow the Guidelines for Engagement at all
times. During this time, ApeCoin DAO members can engage on each topic or with each
Nominee, ask questions, and seek clarification as required prior to voting for the
Nominees.

At any time, Nominees can request the Ape Foundation to withdraw their nomination from
the process by email or on the topic itself.

Phase 3 – Community Vote (if applicable) – 6 days

A community vote will take place on Snapshot if there is a large number of Nominees. If
there are 5 or fewer Nominees, the nomination process is completed, no community vote is
necessary, and the final Nominees become Candidates for the Special Council election.

However, if there are greater than 5 Nominees, then a community vote shall take place.
The vote will be released at the Weekly AIP Release. A weighted voting on Snapshot will
be used to determine the Candidates from the Nominees. A weighted voting means the
following:
Each Nominee will be an option on the Snapshot vote
Each voter decides how to allocate their ApeCoin balance to the list of Nominees
Voters can allocate their ApeCoin to any number of Nominees

Snapshot voting will close at the Weekly Voting Close. The top 5 Nominees become the
Candidates for the election.

In other words, if there are 5 or fewer Nominees, all Nominees will become Candidates.
If there are more than 5 Nominees, then there will be 5 Candidates after the Snapshot
community vote.

Topics for Candidates are moved to the Discourse category Special Council Elections >
Election candidates. The topics of the Nominees that do not become Candidates are moved
to the Discourse category Special Council Elections > Rejected/Withdrawn Nominations.

At the end of this process, the Candidates are identified for the election of the next
Special Council member(s).

Lack of Nominees
In the event that the number of Nominees determined after the KYC and background
verification process is less than the number of Special Council seats up for election,
then the number of Special Council seats shall be reduced by such number of seats and
such seats shall be up for election at the next nomination and election cycle. These
seats shall then return to the original election cycle schedule as outlined in The
Special Council Election Process.

Steps to Implement
The steps to implement the proposal, including associated costs, manpower, and other
resources for each step where applicable.

Email: A new ApeCoin email will be set up exclusively to deal with any matter related to
the nomination (e.g., scnomination@apecoin.com).
Form: A new form will be set-up for each nomination and election cycle by Ape Foundation
to collect information from Applicants.
Discourse: The following categories will be created in Discourse.
Special Council Elections: This category will hold all the sub-categories related to the
nomination and election process. The Discourse category will be read-only, and no topics
will be posted in this category, by either ApeCoin DAO members or the administration team.
Announcements: This category will hold all announcements relating to the nomination and
election process. Specific settings include:
Only the administration team can post topics in this category
Topics will be open for comments
Special Council Nominees: This category will hold all topics for all Nominees and their
profiles for each nomination and election process. Specific settings include:
Only the administration team can post topics in the category
Topics will be open for comments
Election Candidates: This category will hold all topics for all Nominees that become
Candidates for the election process. Specific settings include:

Rejected/Withdrawn Nominations: This category will hold all topics for all Nominees that
withdraw their application or are not voted in as a Candidate.
Only the administration team can post topics in the category

Nominees in this category may apply for future elections
Snapshot: No change in configuration settings for the Snapshot Space. However, each
nomination vote will be a weighted voting. In this scenario, each Nominee is an option
on the vote. A voter then allocates the number of ApeCoin to each Nominee. Nominees will
receive the distribution of the voter power based on the allocation.
