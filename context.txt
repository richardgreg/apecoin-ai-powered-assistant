Title: Welcome to ApeCoin DAO
Category: General
Author: River

The DAO
ApeCoin DAO exists because decentralized governance is critical to building and managing
a globally dispersed community—and therefore critical to the success of the APE
ecosystem. ApeCoin is governed by and for the community. If you hold ApeCoin, you’re
automatically a part of the DAO and able to participate in governance by putting forward
and voting on APE Improvement Proposals (AIPs).

The Foundation
The APE Foundation serves the ApeCoin DAO to steward the growth and development of the
APE ecosystem in a fair and inclusive way. It utilizes the Ecosystem Fund, which is
controlled by a multisig wallet, to pay its expenses as directed by the ApeCoin DAO and
provides an infrastructure for ApeCoin holders to collaborate through open and
permissionless processes 54.

Discourse
Discourse is an open source discussion platform and the first stop for all AIPs. Here,
members of the community can discuss matters of relevance to the ecosystem and provide
feedback on AIPs. This informal dialectic helps AIP authors to strengthen their proposals
and promotes AIPs that are informed by values and goals of the community.

Proposal Process
Discourse is used for idea generation, community discussion, and the preparation of the
AIP Draft. A brief description of the process is below. See the Proposal Process 66 on
the ApeCoin website for further details.

All Topics submitted in Discourse must be approved by a moderator. If it is rejected,
you will be contacted by a moderator directly. If approved, it is open for 7 days.
When the Topic is closed, a moderator will message the author of the Topic directly in
Discourse to put together the AIP Draft.
The AIP Draft will go through the moderation, analysis, and review process.
Moderators will update the community on the status of the Topics in the comments after
the Topic is closed.
Approved AIPs will be put on Snapshot for vote.

Voting Process
All Live AIPs will be posted for vote at the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot 30. A brief summary of
the process is below. See the Voting section 19 on the ApeCoin website for further details.

New AIPs are posted every week on Thursday at 9PM ET and close the following Wednesday at
9PM ET.
ApeCoin DAO members may delegate their votes to another ApeCoin DAO member. Delegation
must occur prior to the posting of the AIP on Snapshot.

Guidelines for Engagement on Discourse

This is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion
Please treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park. We,
too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests
through ongoing conversation. These are not hard and fast rules. They are guidelines to
aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a kind, friendly place for
civilized public discourse.

Improve the Discussion
Help us make this a great place for discussion by always adding something positive to the
discussion, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think
over what you want to say and try again later.
One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening.
Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have
a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.
The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you,
too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree
with some of what is being said.

Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree
You may wish to respond by disagreeing. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas,
not people. Please avoid:
Name-calling
Ad hominem attacks
Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content
Knee-jerk contradiction
Instead, provide thoughtful insights that improve the conversation.
Your Participation Counts

The conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the
future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an
interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.
Discourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best
(and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, watching, muting and
so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.
Let’s leave our community better than we found it.

If You See a Problem, Flag It
Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you.
With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.
When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. Replying encourages bad behavior by acknowledging
it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it. If enough flags
accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.
In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content
and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts;
the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the
community.

Always Be Civil
Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:
Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive,
or hate speech.
Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their
private information.
Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.
These are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any
of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was
featured on the front page of a major news site.
This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language,
links, and images safe for family and friends.

Keep It Tidy
Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time
discussing and less cleaning up. So:
Don’t start a topic in the wrong category; please read the category definitions.
Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.
Don’t post no-content replies.
Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.
Don’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.
Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an
existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.

Post Only Your Own Stuff
You may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission.
You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s
intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.
Powered by You

This site is operated by your friendly local staff and you, the community. If you have
any further questions about how things should work here, open a new topic in the site
feedback category and let’s discuss! If there’s a critical or urgent issue that can’t
be handled by a meta topic or flag, contact us via the staff page.

The APE Foundation website is the DAO hub, providing an interface to educate DAO members
on the governance process and provide easy access to the channels below in order to
streamline the DAO’s operation and enhance its utility.

Discourse is the first stop for all proposals. An AIP (Ape Improvement Proposal) Idea is
submitted as a post in Discourse and must receive confirmation from a moderator that it
complies with DAO-approved guidelines before it appears to the community. ApeCoin holders
must go through a wallet authentication process to post ideas or give feedback to ideas
via comments. Snapshot is used for voting. Proposal drafts that have passed their
respective approval processes become available for voting on Snapshot. ApeCoin holders
must go through a wallet authentication process to vote.

APECOIN IS FOR THE WEB3 ECONOMY.
Culture has found new expression in web3 through art, gaming, entertainment, and events.
The possibilities for blockchain’s impact on culture are so endless that they can’t
possibly all be predicted yet. APE is a token made to support what’s next, controlled and
built on by the community. It will serve as a decentralized protocol layer for
community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse.

THE APE FOUNDATION
The APE Foundation is the steward of ApeCoin. It is not an overseer, but the base layer
on which ApeCoin holders in the ApeCoin DAO can build.

The Foundation facilitates decentralized and community-led governance and is designed to
become more decentralized over time. It is tasked with administering the decisions of the
ApeCoin DAO, and is responsible for day-to-day administration, bookkeeping, project
management, and other tasks that ensure the DAO community’s ideas have the support they
need to become a reality.

The goal of the APE Foundation is to steward the growth and development of the APE
ecosystem in a fair and inclusive way. It utilizes the Ecosystem Fund, which is
controlled by a multisig wallet, to pay its expenses as directed by the ApeCoin DAO and
provides an infrastructure for ApeCoin holders to collaborate through open and
permissionless governance processes.

THE DAO
ApeCoin DAO exists because decentralized governance is critical to building and managing
a globally dispersed community—and therefore critical to the success of the APE ecosystem.

The APE Improvement Proposal Process (see Governance) will allow ApeCoin DAO members to
make decisions regarding Ecosystem Fund allocations, governance rules, projects,
partnerships, and beyond. ApeCoin DAO membership is open to all ApeCoin holders.

THE BOARD
The Special Council of the APE Foundation provides, at the behest of the ApeCoin DAO
members, stewardship and oversight of the APE Foundation. The Special Council members
exist to serve the vision of ApeCoin DAO.

It does this by the following, though they are not limited to the items listed below:

Conducting detailed administrative reviews of AIPs according to the process outlined in
AIP-1
Ensuring the implementation of the ApeCoin DAO’s intentions and wishes as manifested
through approved AIPs

Safeguarding and stewarding the ApeCoin DAO treasury
Serving as primary community liaisons with the APE Foundation and its service providers
in Cayman Islands, facilitating open and effective communication channels

Overseeing the Ape Foundation administrators and other foundation service providers,
ensuring they execute their duties with efficiency and timeliness, aligned with the
ApeCoin DAO's objectives and values.


AIP-1: Proposing the DAO
Category: Process
Submitted by: Cartan Group LLC

ABSTRACT
This document proposes the structure of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)
that would be governed by the holders of ApeCoin, a decentralized token that the
community hopes will serve as the primary token for art, gaming, entertainment, and
events in web3.

MOTIVATION
APE Foundation, which will serve the ApeCoin DAO community and be governed by it, aims
to be the heart of art, gaming, entertainment, and events on the blockchain.

The ApeCoin DAO community will have the power to submit proposals, vote on the most
exciting and promising ideas, and make them real.

The guiding values of APE Foundation are:

Boldness: We don’t shy away from the weird, the hard, or the new.
Equality: One APE equals one APE.
Transparency: Processes and decisions are shared openly with the community.
Collective Responsibility: We leave everything better than we found it.
Persistence: Success is an ouroboros, not a straight line.

RATIONALE
APE Foundation serves the ApeCoin DAO in fostering a community of creators and everyday
innovators with aligning motivation and values to shape the future of web3.

The short-term vision is to facilitate the launch of the best product feasible today in
a way that aligns with the DAO’s motivation and values by balancing productivity and
governance with bottom-up contribution, while minimizing politics.

To achieve this, it is imperative that participating in idea submission, commentary,
proposal submission, and voting is restricted to ApeCoin DAO members. Holding ApeCoin is
the only requirement for membership in the DAO.

In keeping with the core APE Foundation value of transparency, all ideas and commentary
in Discourse, proposals, votes cast, and voting outcomes will be publically available
to view.

GUIDELINES

Every year, there is a DAO-wide vote to determine which DAO members will serve on a
special council on the APE Foundation (the DAO’s “Board”). The purpose of the Board is
to administer DAO proposals and serve the vision of the community.

A Board member may be removed and replaced prior to the term pursuant to a majority vote
of token holders.
The total cost of implementation must be clear in order for a proposal to go to vote.

DAO members must search past proposals to ensure any idea they intend to write a proposal
for has not already been submitted.
If a suggested proposal directly conflicts with a proposal that is currently up for vote,
the second proposal should not go for a vote until a decision is made on the first proposal
to avoid approval of opposing requirements.
A suggested proposal that directly conflicts with another approved proposal cannot go to
vote for three months after the original proposal has been implemented to avoid wasting
community assets.

Proposals will not be considered/put up for a vote if they involve illegal activity, hate
speech, pornographic material, or are at odds with the mission or values of the APE Foundation.

KEY TERMS
AIP (APE Improvement Proposal) - a document proposing a new feature, project, activity, goal,
piece of information, or change to any proposal that has already been implemented.

AIP Idea - the first step in the process of creating an official AIP, which will be
presented to the community for gathering informal feedback for a period of seven days.

AIP Draft - the second step in the process of creating an official AIP, which can only be
submitted after the original AIP idea has gathered feedback from the community for seven
days in the proper channel. An AIP draft must be submitted directly to a moderator via
predetermined AIP templates.

AIP Template - the preset format for an AIP draft, which will vary slightly depending on
the nature of the intended AIP.

AIP Author - the DAO member responsible for beginning the APE Improvement Process,
starting with presenting the idea to the community via the proper AIP idea process.

The AIP author is responsible for incorporating relevant feedback, submitting the
subsequent AIP draft via the proper AIP template to the moderator, and responding to 
questions or requests for clarifications from DAO members and moderators. Any ApeCoin
holder can be an AIP author.

AIP Categories - the predetermined classification system for organizing AIPs by their
nature or intent. They are: Core Proposal, Ecosystem Fund Allocation Proposal
(a subcategory of Core Proposal), Brand Decision Proposal
(a subcategory of Core Proposal), Process Proposal, and Informational Proposal.

Core Proposal - a proposal that would be considered the main activities of the DAO, with
subcategories that can be expanded on over time via proposal submission.

Ecosystem Fund Allocation Proposal - a proposal about how the Ecosystem Fund should be
spent. A subcategory of Core Proposals.

Brand Decision Proposal - a proposal about to whom the community wants to attach its
name. This is different from an Ecosystem Fund Allocation Proposal in that it can have
associated costs to implement but is not at its core a proposal about Ecosystem Fund
Allocation. A subcategory of Core Proposals.

Process Proposal - a proposal about making a change to a process or proposing an
implementation. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making
process, and changes to the tools or environment of the DAO or Foundation.

Informational Proposal - a proposal that provides general guidelines or information to
the community but does not propose a new feature.

Resubmission Proposal - a proposal that was previously submitted but did not pass either
due to initial rejection by moderators or the Board, or by not passing a vote. All
proposal categories have a special template for resubmission that the author must link
to the original proposal, clearly state why it did not pass, and clearly explain how
the resubmission is different.

AIP Analysis Report - a report conducted by a project management team engaged by the
APE Foundation to ensure that all costs, steps to implement, legal considerations,
third-party review requirements, potential conflicts of interests, and any further
implications have been properly considered and identified. This is considered to be a
service for the community given that AIP authors will be submitting drafts with little
to no resources.

APE Improvement Proposal Draft & Analysis Report (AIP DAR Package) - both the AIP Draft
(submitted by the author) and the AIP Analysis Report (submitted by the project
management team engaged by the APE Foundation) should be defined as a package after the
analysis report is conducted, as they should only be considered together from that point on.

AIP Moderation - the act of reviewing an AIP DAR Package to determine whether or not the
AIP draft meets the predetermined and DAO-approved guidelines and therefore is eligible
to move to the next step in the process. If an AIP DAR Package passes AIP moderation,
it becomes a Pending AIP.

Pending AIP - the AIP status after AIP DAR, which is only reached if it passes AIP Moderation.
Post-Moderation Tagging - the process of tagging all Pending AIPs that have successfully
been through the AIP analysis report and AIP moderation phases. There are two tags given
at this stage: 1) “Straight to Vote,” which is for any pending AIP where costs, content,
and implications are considered to be straightforward and of no risk to the well-being
of the DAO. 2) “Needs Administrative Review,” which is for any pending AIP with costs,
content, or implications that are considered to be complicated or a potential risk to the
well-being of the DAO and therefore must be reviewed by the Board of the DAO.

Administrative Review - the process of evaluating pending AIPs that have been tagged as
“Needs Administrative Review” to determine whether they should be halted or sent to vote
by the community.

Return for Clarification - a type of administrative classification that requires the AIP
author to clarify certain information regarding the Pending AIP. This classification would
be given in cases such as cost to implement being unclear, proposing to utilize a larger
percentage of the Ecosystem Fund than is justified based on the value it would provide to
the community, or being in direct conflict with an active AIP.

Return for Reconstruction - a type of administrative classification that requires the
proposer to restart the proposal submission process because the Pending AIP violates
DAO-approved requirements, or in cases of violation of the law, reasonable suspicion
of fraud or other misleading information, or the pending AIP being at odds with the
mission, values, or well-being of the Foundation or DAO.

Weekly AIP Release - every Thursday at 9PM ET, when all AIPs that are ready to go live
are released together in a batch.

Weekly Voting Close - when all AIPs in a Weekly AIP Release batch close for voting,
which happens the following Wednesday at 9PM ET.

Live AIP - an AIP that has passed all required approval stages and is launched for the
community to vote on it. The voting options for a Live AIP are “In favor” and “Against.”
Voting “In favor” means the voter is in favor of implementing the AIP exactly as-is.

Voting “Against” means the vote is against implementing the AIP exactly as-is — you may
vote “Against” to encourage the author to resubmit the AIP after making changes.

Final AIP - an AIP that has completed the voting process. There are two subcategories here: Accepted and Rejected.

Implementation of Accepted AIP - the process of implementing an AIP that has been
accepted by the community via a vote, based on the predetermined steps laid out in the
Draft/Template and Analysis Report phases.

THE PROCESS
Phase 1: AIP Idea

An AIP Idea is submitted as a post in Discourse and must receive confirmation from a
moderator that it complies with DAO-approved guidelines before it appears to the community.
The person or people submitting the AIP Idea will be referred to as the author or authors.

Multiple members can work together on an AIP idea, but it should be submitted only once.
The AIP idea informally gathers comments via Discourse.
Seven days after being posted in the Discourse, the community feedback process for the AIP Idea will close.

Phase 2: AIP Draft

Once the seven-day feedback window has passed and a moderator has closed the Discourse topic, a
moderator will provide the AIP author with the appropriate template.
A proposal typically includes:
Abstract - Two or three sentences that summarize the proposal.

Motivation - A statement on why the APE Community should implement the proposal.

Rationale - An explanation of how the proposal aligns with the APE Community’s
mission and guiding values.

Key Terms (optional) - Definitions of any terms within the proposal that are unique to
the proposal, new to the APE Community, and/or industry-specific.

Specifications - A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.

Steps to Implement - The steps to implement the proposal, including associated costs,
manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable.

Timeline - Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones,
and completion dates.

Overall Cost - The total cost to implement the proposal.
The author will fill out the template based on the original AIP Idea, incorporating any
feedback provided by the community that helps the idea better serve the DAO.

The author can add additional fields to the template if necessary to fully communicate
the intentions, specifics, and implications of the AIP Draft.
Proposals that did not make it through the respective approval process and are being
resubmitted should also include:

Link to original proposal
Reason it was not approved
Changes that have been made and why it should now be approved
Category options:
Core: Ecosystem Fund Allocation
Core: Ecosystem Fund Allocation (Resubmission)
Core: Brand Decision
Core: Brand Decision (Resubmission)

Process
Process (Resubmission)
Informational
Informational (Resubmission)
The moderator may then continue communication with the author to inform them of any
incorrect or missing information that needs to be changed—or clarifications that need to
be made—in order for the AIP Draft to comply with the DAO-approved guidelines and move
to the next step.
If the author does not respond to a moderator’s request to change, update, or make
clarifications on the AIP Draft within 30 days, the AIP Draft will be automatically
rejected as having failed to comply with the DAO-approved guidelines.
When the moderator confirms that an AIP Draft complies with the DAO-approved guidelines,
they assign a number to the AIP for identification purposes throughout the rest of the
process. From this point on, the AIP is referred to as “AIP-#: (Name) - (Category)”.
For example, this AIP is “AIP-1: Proposing the DAO - Process”.

Phase 3: AIP Analysis Report

The AIP Draft is then reviewed by a project management team engaged by APE Foundation,
who will provide an in-depth AIP Analysis Report.
The purpose of the AIP Analysis Report is to ensure that all costs, steps to implement,

legal considerations, third-party review requirements, potential conflicts of interests,
and any further implications have been properly considered and identified in order to
ensure the DAO members have enough information to make an informed decision.

This is considered to be a service for the DAO community given that AIP authors may be
submitting drafts with little to no resources.

Phase 4: AIP Moderation

The AIP DAR Package is reviewed by a team of moderators.
The AIP DAR Package will either be approved or not approved based on whether it adheres
to the DAO-approved guidelines.
If an AIP DAR Package is approved as complying with DAO-approved guidelines, it becomes
a Pending AIP and moves to Phase 5.
If an AIP DAR Package fails to comply with DAO-approved guidelines, it is eligible for
resubmission unless in cases of violation of the law or reasonable suspicion of fraud or
other misleading information.

Phase 5: Post-Moderation Tagging

Pending AIPs that have passed AIP Moderation will then either be tagged as “Straight to
Vote” or “Needs Administrative Review”’ as each term is defined and described in this Proposal.
The “Straight to Vote” tag is given for any pending AIP whose costs, content, and implications
are considered to be straightforward and of no risk to the well-being of the DAO. Any
Pending AIP that is tagged as “Straight to Vote” will skip to Phase 7.
The “Needs Administrative Review” tag is given for any pending AIP whose costs, content,
or implications are considered to be complicated or a potential risk to the well-being
of the DAO. Any Pending AIP that is tagged as “Needs Administrative Review” must go
through Phase 6.

Phase 6: Administrative Review

This phase is only for Pending AIPs that have been tagged with “Needs Administrative Review.”
When this happens, the Board, serving in an administrative capacity, will determine
whether further action is required prior to a Pending AIP proceeding to Phase 7.

Pending AIPs that the Board determines do not require additional action will be tagged
as “Approved for Voting” and proceed to Phase 7.
If the Board decides to return a Pending AIP for further clarification or action, they
must provide a clear explanation of why and tag it as either “Return for Reconstruction”
or “Return for Clarification.”
Reasons to tag as “Return for Reconstruction” or “Return for Clarification” may include
but are not limited to:

Cost to implement unclear/not able to be calculated (tagged as “Return for Clarification”)
Proposes to use more than 5% of the Ecosystem Fund (tagged as “Return for Clarification”)
Conflicts with another proposal (tagged as “Return for Clarification”)

Proposal is at odds with the mission/values of the DAO (tagged as “Return for Reconstruction”)
Proposal is at odds with the well-being of the DAO (tagged as “Return for Reconstruction”)
Violations of law, or against advice of counsel for APE Foundation (tagged as “Return for Reconstruction”)

Reasonable suspicion of fraud or other misleading information (tagged as “Return for Reconstruction”)

Phase 7: Live AIP

Drafts that have passed their respective approval processes will become a Live AIP on
Snapshot during the next Weekly AIP Release, which is when new AIPs are released in
batches every Thursday at 9PM ET.

Moderators are the only ones that can post AIPs to Snapshot because they must ensure
that each one has gone through the correct approvals process.
Once live on Snapshot, Live AIPs are open to voting until Weekly Voting Close, which
is when all Live AIPs from a given batch close for voting at 9PM ET on the Wednesday
following their release.
The voting options are “In favor” and “Against.” Voting “In favor” means the voter
is in favor of implementing the AIP exactly as-is. Voting “Against” means the vote is
against implementing the AIP exactly as-is — voters may vote “Against” to encourage
the author to resubmit the AIP after making changes.

Phase 8: Final AIP

If by the Vote Close Time the Live AIP has not gotten any votes or is tied, it will
be tagged as “Stalled” and be eligible for Resubmission.
In all other cases, after the Vote Close Time, Live AIPs are moved to Final AIPs.

There are two subcategories for the Final AIP status: accepted and rejected.
Rejected Final AIPs will have the chance to be resubmitted via the appropriate
Resubmission Template if the author contacts a moderator to initiate this process.

Accepted Final AIPs will move into implementation.

Phase 9: Implementation

For Accepted Final AIPs, implementation will begin based on the steps outlined in the AIP
template.
The project management team engaged by the APE Foundation is responsible for making sure
this happens but not responsible for doing it themselves.

The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be
immaterially or materially altered to optimize for security, usability, to protect APE
holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an
AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.

SPECIFICATIONS
DAO Hub: APE Foundation website, which will provide an interface to educate DAO members
on the governance process and provide easy access to the channels described below in
order to streamline the DAO’s operation and enhance its utility.

Communication Channel: Discourse (Phase 1)
ApeCoin holders must go through a wallet authentication process to post ideas or give
feedback to ideas via comments.
AIP Idea posts must be approved by a moderator to ensure it meets all predetermined
guidelines and template requirements.

All posts and comments will be regularly monitored by both a team of community managers
engaged by the APE Foundation and by the DAO community members themselves. There will be
zero tolerance for hate speech anywhere on this platform.

The author of an idea via a post in Discourse cannot edit the original post. If the
author wants to propose changes to the original idea, the author must do this via the
comments.

Seven (7) days after it has been posted, ideas become closed to community feedback
and will be locked by a moderator or community manager.
Process for Draft Submission via Template: (Phase 2)

Once an idea is locked in Discourse after the seven-day community feedback period,
a moderator will contact the author to provide the appropriate template.
The author should then submit an official AIP draft to the moderator using the
template.

The moderator may then continue communication with the author to inform them of any
incorrect or missing information that needs to be changed—or clarifications that
need to be made— for the AIP Draft to move to the next step.

If the author does not respond to a moderator’s request to change, update, or make
clarifications on the AIP Draft within 30 days, the AIP Draft will be automatically rejected.
Platform where Live AIPs are Hosted: Snapshot (Phase 7)

ApeCoin holders must go through a wallet authentication process to vote on Snapshot.
Moderators are the only ones allowed to launch AIPs on Snapshot as they must ensure each
AIP has gone through the correct approval process.

See AIP-2 for further details.

AIP-2: Voting Process
Category: Process
Author: Cartan Group LLC

ABSTRACT
This document proposes the voting protocol for the DAO outlined in AIP-1.

MOTIVATION
The main motivation behind this proposal is to create the voting infrastructure for
ApeCoin holders to participate in the decision-making of the DAO, the governing body of
the Foundation. The core criteria for the proposed voting system are:

not requiring gas payment
ensuring transparency
expanding governance participation to all holders of ApeCoin
One of the goals of launching a token was to facilitate decentralized community
governance in the form of the ApeCoin DAO. Without a voting system in place, arriving at
consensus on proposals would be centralized, with only a few people holding
decision-making abilities. This proposal aims to avoid this result.

RATIONALE
As the ecosystem evolves and expands, a well-defined system is required to gather new
community ideas and provide a clear path for these ideas to be approved for
implementation. A proposal process is foundational to this system becoming a reality.

A proposal process, however, needs an accompanying consensus mechanism. It must be fair,
transparent, and low-cost to place votes. Balancing each of these requirements is
challenging. On-chain solutions make it costly to vote. Off-chain solutions, like the one
proposed, are less expensive, but require actions to take place off chain.

This proposal outlines a voting protocol that seeks to balance the pros and cons of 
voting approaches, and to hold up the core APE Foundation guiding values of equality and
transparency. This voting protocol can be found below in the following SPECIFICATIONS
section.

SPECIFICATIONS
Assuming the approval of AIP-1, implement Snapshot as the voting mechanism / protocol
where:

Only ApeCoin token holders may vote
Token holders will have the ability to delegate votes
New proposals that meet the required guidelines will be launched in batches every
Thursday at 9PM ET
The voting opens immediately upon launch
The voting options for a Live AIP are “In favor” and “Against.” Voting “In favor” means
the voter is in favor of implementing the AIP exactly as-is. Voting “Against” means th
 vote is against implementing the AIP exactly as-is — one may vote “Against” to encourage
 the author to resubmit the AIP after making changes.
The voting for each proposal in each weekly batch will be open for voting for six days,
closing at 9PM ET on the following Wednesday
Proposals that are approved by the holders of the requisite number of ApeCoin are moved
to the APE Foundation for implementation
Only moderators can post AIPs to Snapshot because they must ensure that each one has
gone through the correct approvals process

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT
Purchased ENS domain
Created specific space on Snapshot
Implemented ecosystem-specific voting strategy
Set administrator addresses
Set voting rules
Set restrictions in Snapshot so that only moderators can launch proposals

AIP-9: Boring Security - Ecosystem Fund Allocation
Category: Ecosystem Fund Allocation
Author: Feld

ABSTRACT
This document outlines the Boring Security Mission statement and alignment with the
greater BAYC and NFT community. In order to grow the pie, we must first secure the
crust, and protect the gooey insides from malicious actors.

MOTIVATION
The Boring Security DAO has tracked over $50mm worth of hacked/scammed NFTs in the
space and has attributed it largely to lack of awareness and education on the NFT
communities’ part. There have been no large-scale vendor neutral efforts in the space
to educate, inform, and provide timely updates such that the community can make better
informed risk decisions with their capital and NFTs. This changes now.

RATIONALE
With BAYC holders being the largest target for hackers/scammers, the DAO will face
unique challenges over the coming months and years as it pertains to Security.
Bringing a whole slew of new users into DeFi primitives, they will face even more
challenges in ensuring the safety of their coins, NFTs, and digital assets more broadly.
As the ecosystem evolves and web3 integrations become more prevalent, getting a BAYC
holder to sign a potentially malicious transaction will be the holy grail of exploits,
and one that should concern this DAO greatly.

SPECIFICATIONS
Dune Analytics to help determine trends, track user behavior, and guide decisions of
resource allocation.
Social Media to conduct outreach, education, and
Smart Contract Review Tools - We hope to make partnerships with established auditing
companies in the space to give us the ability to do preliminary safety checks on minting
contracts, airdropped tokens, etc.

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT
After Funding is secured we plan to:

Setup Coordinape and fund it with a portion of our Apecoin each month. DAO participants
will be paid out every month, based on their effort into the DAO and the perceived value
of other contributors in the contributor bucket.
Hire (1) staff member out of a legal entity already created to facilitate this effort.
This staff member will be doing outreach, tracking attendance to courses, website content
updates, issuing our BS101 NFTs, coordinating volunteer activities, Coordinape payout
handling, and most importantly tracking our metrics and helping the group work towards
them, and potentially more depending on their skill set or desire.
Partnerships, Website design, Giveaways, Social Media blitzes, etc.
We believe with the ($80,000 worth of apecoin) we will be able to have a 6 month runway
of associated costs. Beer money for volunteers, a full-time staff member, and our
software needs. However, being able to up the volunteer budget or being able to pay
people for valuable contributions outside of coordinape to help us push our milestones
further, faster, is the goal. This is why we are requesting funding from multiple sources.

TIMELINE
2022 OKRs Summary:
Achieve a meaningful number members to join the Boring Security community
Funding to support Boring Security objectives long-term

Milestones

Security Educational Courses w/ POAP
Become the largest security communities in the NFT space.
Active monitoring, reviews, and tooling for the space.
Roadmap and Milestones

Phase 1
Summary: During phase 1 the team will be designing and developing Educational Courses
geared toward changing risky behavior in the NFT Space, eg. Blind Signing, risky
approvals, etc. The team will also accumulate and collect the necessary wallet, event,
asset, approval data to analyze and ruthlessly prioritize our roadmap.
Milestones: Courseware, POAPs, and establish DAO structure.

Create NFT security Educational courseware targeting High Risk individuals based on
behavioral analysis.
Promote courseware via social awareness and engagement with key NFT communities.
Incentivize courseware through POAP and collaborations with NFT projects (giveaways,
whitelist)
Establish the optimal team and organizational structure to achieve the goals of a
long-lasting public utility

Phase 2
Summary: In order to be successful in a Security project it is essential to make data
driven decisions that enable us to understand the likelihood and severity of attacks.
Milestones: Curate Content, Go public, Smart Contract Review, More volunteers

Response team deployment
Paced Launch of the project (Open Socials, Discord, Advertising Material)
Metrics developed to track % of ‘key projects’ that recommend newcomers to utilize
Boring Security

Phase 3
Summary: Operational Success - Growth
Milestones: Partnerships, Growth, Tools, Trust

Full-time active monitoring of the space, threats, and scams
Develop scope beyond courseware. Establish mechanisms for proactive and reactive
airdrop/smart contract reviews for user safety.
Develop tools, dashboards, technical primitives to protect the community
Partnerships with large projects, potential companies or other DAOs to help spread
awareness and bring NFTs safely to the masses.

OVERALL COST
The initial ask from the DAO is 6969 $ape coin, but Boring Security has some plans to
generate additional supporter funding through Supporter NFT issuance, other grant
applications (Opensea grant is pending) and others. However, there will likely be ongoing
requests for funding that we will likely come back to the DAO for additional funding,
and provide updates of our progress, etc.
