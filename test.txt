The APE Foundation website is the DAO hub, providing an interface to educate DAO members on the
governance process and provide easy access to the channels below in order to streamline the
DAOâ€™s operation and enhance its utility.
Discourse is the first stop for all proposals. An AIP (Ape Improvement Proposal) Idea is submitted
as a post in Discourse and must receive confirmation from a moderator that it complies with DAO-approved
guidelines before it appears to the community. ApeCoin holders must go through a wallet authentication
process to post ideas or give feedback to ideas via comments.
Snapshot is used for voting. Proposal drafts that have passed their respective approval processes become
available for voting on Snapshot. ApeCoin holders must go through a wallet authentication process to vote.
